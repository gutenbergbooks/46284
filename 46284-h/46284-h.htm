<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Exactly in the middle of the railway
bridge by which the Salzach
is spanned Bavarian territory
ceases and Austria begins. I
knew that; but I was much less impressed
by this probably interesting fact (for, why
on earth would one have taken so much care
to inform me, if it were not interesting?)
than by the singular beauty of the spot. I
had just a glimpse of the two isolated hills
between which the river flows, of the lovely
valley thus formed, and of the lofty fortress
that rises above the towers and spires of the
city. In the next minute the train stopped
and cries of "Salzburg, all change!" or its
German equivalent, resounded.</p>

<p>At once my neighbour, an irascible
Frenchman, who from Munich had shared
the carriage with me, flew up in a rage,
gesticulating, full of noise.</p>

<p>"It is not true," he cried, "I don't have
to change!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I muttered something like "Custom
Regulations," but he went on vociferating:</p>

<p>"It is not true! I was told in Paris that
the handbags and the other small things
would be examined in the carriage, and the
heavy luggage in Vienna. I refuse to get
out."</p>

<p>He was right. I had been told the same
thing in Munich, but, as an Englishman, I
was wont to hold my peace. So I alighted.</p>

<p>In the same minute an official approached
our carriage and invited the
Frenchman to do as he was bid. The official
was not very polite, it must be said in justice
to the Parisian, but the latter clamoured at
once, shaking his fists: "It was disgusting,
and he was going to do as it pleased him!"
Whereupon the man with the red cap introduced
himself in a gruff voice as an Imperial
and Royal Official and menaced his antagonist
with immediate arrest. I tried to dissuade
both from quarrelling, but the Frenchman
was deaf to all reason.</p>

<p>When at last a police officer came, the
nervous little man left the carriage with an
explosion of wrath and stormed to the door
leading into the station building. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
further happened to him, I do not know, nor
will the reader ever learn it. For this
Frenchman had evidently been created only
to set free a certain corner seat in my railway
carriage.</p>

<p>For various reasons, a few of which will
appear in this story, I will probably never
return to Austria. But, gentle reader, <i>you</i>
may visit this beautiful country. Well, if
you chance to travel in a first-class corridor
carriage numbered P.3.33, and in the section
marked C, greet the corner seats next to the
window from me. Not because I sat in one
of these corner seats when my story opened,
nor because the other was occupied by the
irascible little Frenchman, who has already
stepped out of my story, but for the sake of
the traveller who succeeded him and who was
no less a person than the heroine of this book.</p>

<p>And now I will try and tell you all about
it, or better, about her, supposing that the
noise of the shells does not disturb me too
much. For you must know that I am
writing in the trenches. After all, I am
used to the continuous concert, and I am not
fifty yards distant from a man who is working
on a chemistry treatise.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">I.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">I had opened my boxes and bags, and
had closed them again after a customs
officer's pretence at looking at the
things which were inside. I wanted
now to go back to my carriage, but was told
that I had to pass through an adjoining
room. Heaven does not know why; much
less does anybody else. In that room, out of
which a glass door led to the platform, I had
to wait. Not many minutes, I was assured;
but their quality made up for the quantity.
They were hateful minutes. There I was,
pasted (if I may say so) to that glass door
and looking at that unreachable goal, my
carriage, which was standing just in front
of me.</p>

<p>Outside a few travellers, favoured for
some unknown reason, either by the officials
or by fate, were walking leisurely up and
down, and I noticed amongst them a very
smart officer with a tall lady. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
revolving around her with courtesies that
reminded me singularly of a cock's compliments
to a hen. He had a most wonderful
uniform which fitted him to perfection. He
had also a moustache, oh, what a moustache!
It gave me an idea of how his horse must be
curried. And he wore a single eye-glass,
which obliged him to make the most
charming grimaces. He was holding his
sword by the hilt, except at such moments
when he let it drag along the ground, in
order to produce a graceful clinking which
I could hear through my accursed glass
door.</p>

<p>At last we were relieved and set free. I
hurried to my carriage to find that the porter
whom I had entrusted with my bags and
valises had set them down so as to mark all
the seats. I would be alone.</p>

<p>"Are all the seats in this section occupied?"
asked a rather rattling voice behind
me.</p>

<p>I turned round and saw my pretty officer
with his lady.</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "I think I am
alone," whereupon the lady at once entered
the carriage. The officer remained outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and closed the door while she, lowering the
window, leaned outside to continue her conversation.
I guessed that my journey would
be <i>en t√™te √† t√™te</i>, and, of course, wondered
whether she was young and pretty. Her
companion was himself such an accomplished
beauty, that I had in fact omitted to look
at her. Anyhow, what I saw at present,
although it was the wrong side only, the
reverse of the medal, to be polite, was not at
all to be despised. But when the toss was
made, would the head be worthy of the tail?</p>

<p>At last a faint whistle was heard.</p>

<p>"Remember to write!" exclaimed the
officer outside, while the train stirred, moved
groaning forward, and slowly began rolling
out of the station. For a while the lady
remained leaning out of the window and
waving her handkerchief. Then, at length,
she sat back in her seat, the seat which the
little Frenchman had occupied, and from
which his temper (or was it my luck?) had
removed him.</p>

<p>She was uncommonly pretty, although
she at once assumed an elaborate air of
indifference. She even pouted a little, but
it only helped to show her fleshy, red lips to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a better advantage. And her features were
much too soft as to be spoiled by that alleged
air of indifference. They were not very
regular, these features, but they formed a
handsome whole. And now, as a little smile
crept over them, a dimple, a tiny, sweet
dimple, appeared near the left corner of her
mouth.</p>

<p>Why had she smiled? To show that
dimple and her lovely teeth? Or had she
been thinking of her companion? That
smile&mdash;was it coquetry, or some pleasing
remembrance? Or had mockery made her
smile?</p>

<p>What was she to that officer? A sister?
A wife? A mistress?</p>

<p>How old was she? I wished she would
take off that bonnet. Bonnets deceive. This
is the reason why they play such an
important part in woman's life.</p>

<p>I did not know much about millinery,
but this was rather a showy bonnet. So
was the rest of the toilet. She looked like
an officer's wife. Besides, had she been his
sister, he would scarcely have played the
cock and hen game. But then, if she was
his wife, he probably would not have played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it either! His had been a suitor's behaviour.</p>

<p>I had reached this point of my meditations
when she took off her gloves, and I saw
that she had no rings on her fingers. And
then, as if to satisfy my wishes, she removed
the bonnet. She was fair, with a copper
sheen on her hair, and probably not more
than twenty.</p>

<p>My penetration, for I thought myself
pretty shrewd and sharp-sighted, constructed
now rapidly the following theory: <i>She</i> was
a young gentlewoman, her tall figure being a
proof of her high breed. She was well off,
the showy dress and her travelling first-class
confirmed it. She was nicely brought up, as
became a young and noble lady, for she wore
no jewellery. (In my idea wearing jewellery
is inconsistent with a young lady's good
education.) As for the officer, he was neither
a brother, nor a husband, nor a lover, but
some friend or relation, who had just
accompanied her to the railway station in
order to help her with her luggage, and so
on.</p>

<p>Now, all this proves only, that I was
then an inexperienced youth of 21, easy of
belief, and superficial. If I tell you that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was a musician (I do not say: I <i>am</i>; I say:
I <i>was</i>) you will understand my character
altogether.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had to interrupt my history. Our
Father which is in the War Office had sent us
our daily jam. I wonder whether my pretty
Austrian officer, whom I first saw eight years
ago at the Salzburg railway station, is still
alive, and whether he has jam, too? And
whether he thinks of me as I do of him, and
whether he remembers that Sunday afternoon
when he put her, my Austrian love,
in my railway carriage?</p>

<p>She was sitting there, looking out of the
window. It was now a quarter of an hour
since we had left Salzburg, and the train
had got on its even, rapid pace that it would
keep up for the afternoon.</p>

<p>I did not dare to speak to my fair
Comtesse. This was the rank which my
imagination had given her. If, when
travelling, you do not start a conversation
at once, you generally never will. So I
fretted. I had nothing to read, not even a
paper. I did not want to sleep, besides, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
never could sleep on a train. As for her,
she hardly moved.</p>

<p>Thus another quarter of an hour had
passed, when the conductor, opening the door
of the corridor, asked for our tickets. I
could not help feeling surprised when I saw
the man, for he looked somewhat like a twin
brother of the little Frenchman. He was of
the same size, had the same black hair, the
same black moustache and pointed tuft of
beard on his chin. It was so striking that
my English brain, brought up chiefly on
detective stories, smelt at once a mystery. I
could not refrain from stepping out with him
on to the corridor where, in order to make
certain whether the little Frenchman and
the conductor were but one person, I asked
him what the next stop was. He answered
and began chatting. It was quite another
voice and, while my Frenchman spoke German
only with great difficulty, this conductor
gave me an example of the volubility with
which the Viennese people speak their broad,
good-humoured dialect. The mystery was
only chance.</p>

<p>"A nice girl," said the man smiling and
blinking with his eyes half closed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
direction of the Comtesse.</p>

<p>"Where is she travelling to?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Vienna," he answered. And then,
raising his eyes with a matchmaking expression
under his black eyebrows, "I travel
the whole way with you," said he. "If you
will, I'll try and leave you alone with her."</p>

<p>I understood. My backsheesh was soon
handed over, whereupon&mdash;I suppose&mdash;that
high-priest of the railway church mentally
pronounced the decisive words which were to
unite us for the duration of our journey.</p>

<p>I must say, however, that this matrimonial
benediction took no immediate effect.
For when I returned to my seat, I still had
no courage to talk to my fair <i>vis-√†-vis</i>.</p>

<p>She had not moved and was looking with
desperate equanimity at the landscape that
was galloping before her eyes.</p>

<p>I felt silly. I often do.</p>

<p class="b1">Like a child, I busied myself with the
window strap. It was at that moment that
I noticed the small white plate affixed to the
door:</p>

<div class="bord1"><p class="pn center large">

P. 3.33. C.

</p></div>

<p class="p1">P. 3.33 was the number of the car, and
C the number of the section. But P. C. were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
also the initials of my name. And, as I have
not yet introduced myself to the reader, I
take this opportunity of telling him (or her)
that my name is Patrick Cooper, of London,
son of Daniel Cooper and Co., Ltd., insurance
brokers, (<i>and Co.</i> being quite a
negligible quantity, while <i>Ltd.</i> is not).</p>

<p>I suppose that music and superstition
must be of a very near relationship. Even
now, although I am no longer a musician,
but a Lance-Corporal (all honour to me!) my
superstition survives. For instance: I am
a passionate hunter of rats. Well, whenever
I miss one, you may be sure that the next
lot of bacon we get is bad.</p>

<p>Therefore it will be admitted that the
discovery of my initials on the plate of the
carriage door could not but fill me with a
certain awe. Yet, not with awe alone!
Also with curiosity. What was the meaning
of 3.33?</p>

<p>I spent a few minutes over this highly
interesting riddle, until another thought
came, namely: If I were not soon to engage
in conversation with the Comtesse, I should
have spent my backsheesh in vain.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It was half-past
three, which meant that I had already lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fifty minutes. All right! The figures 3.33
were to have a meaning. If in three
minutes, at 3.33, nothing happened, <i>I would
talk</i>. The weather might afford quite a
suitable topic, if not new nor in any way
sensational, so at least not at all offensive.
I accordingly prepared myself. Two minutes.&mdash;One
minute and a half.&mdash;One minute.&mdash;A
half minute....</p>

<p>The Westinghouse brake underneath the
car made itself heard with a grating, harsh
shriek, there was a shock that ran through
the train, and at 3.33 exactly the Comtesse
was pitched from her seat into my arms,
while one of my bags came to the floor and
the train to a sudden halt. In the next
second, however, a terrific dash made it move
backwards, and we were both thrown from
my seat into her's.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the fair one, after
we had struggled out of our mutual embrace.</p>

<p>Outside many people began to cry all at
once and hurried footsteps were heard.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong," answered I.</p>

<p>There was, indeed. On that particular
spot the line, for some technical reason,
was only single tracked, and railway smashes
were therefore not altogether avoidable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The Comtesse wanted to alight at once,
but I held her back.</p>

<p>"What for?" I asked. "Are you not
all right here? The worst is over. If there
is anything to be seen, it must be most
unpleasant."</p>

<p>She settled down again in her seat. Her
fright had apparently been great, to judge
from her paleness and from the way she
looked, wide eyed, at me. Out of the bag
which had tumbled down from the net, I took
a flask of brandy and a little goblet.</p>

<p>"Drink this," I said, offering her a few
drops.</p>

<p>She accepted, and then:</p>

<p>"How phlegmatic you English are!"
said she. "Look at these people...."</p>

<p>The excitement outside was incredible.
Strange voices were heard. Passengers and
railway servants were running up and down
in a most foolish and useless fashion. Two
gentlemen were shouting at each other; they
were in a hot discussion about what was to
be done. One woman was kneeling and
praying hysterically at the foot of a telegraph
post which she probably was mistaking for a
way-side cross. And everybody was talking,
crying. It was all the more ridiculous, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
there had, in fact, happened nothing of
importance. Both engines and the luggage
vans were badly damaged, but nobody was
injured. If I want to imagine, what it
means nowadays when I read: "Austrians
defeated"&mdash;I have only to remember this
scene of panic and disorder, and I know at
once.</p>

<p>Nothing, so to say, had happened; but
the men, having all lost their presence of
mind, behaved like sheep, looking to each
other, appealing for help, while most of the
women were weeping, pallid, with cadaverous
lips.</p>

<p>In England everybody would have been
quiet, perhaps a little annoyed, perhaps
amused, but in any case not a bit frightened.
That was why the Comtesse had called me
phlegmatic. I hoped that it was my calmness
which had made her guess my English
nationality: I was too proud of my German
to suspect that my pronounciation had
betrayed me.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the ice was broken, and we
were now chatting comfortably. Slowly the
excitement of the other passengers subsided
and a period of silence followed. People
went back into their carriages. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
little conductor had disappeared; he was
walking to the next signal-box, where he
would telephone for help. The wait seemed
interminable.</p>

<p>The Comtesse began to fidget.</p>

<p>"You still look a little pale," said I.
"Do you feel well?"</p>

<p>She nodded meekly.</p>

<p>"But not entirely well? You feel tired?
You have got a headache?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she protested smilingly.</p>

<p>"I see. You want a little more brandy."</p>

<p>"No, no," she repeated.</p>

<p>But I was not satisfied. She seemed
distressed.</p>

<p>"You are anxious about your luggage.
Do you want me to go and see?"</p>

<p>"I have no luggage."</p>

<p>"You have no luggage?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I was surprised. For she had brought
none into the car either. Still, that was no
business of mine.</p>

<p>"Can't I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>"You may tell me the time."</p>

<p>"It is a quarter past four."</p>

<p>"And since when are we here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>I named the foreshadowed moment:</p>

<p>"3.33."</p>

<p>"Three-quarters of an hour!" she cried.
"But we will arrive in Vienna at an
impossible hour."</p>

<p>She looked alarmed.</p>

<p>At last, after what appeared an endless
delay, but what was in reality only another
half-hour, an engine arrived, and both trains
tied together were drawn into the next
station. There followed a lot of man≈ìuvring;
the train which had run into our's had first
to be removed, and then the two engines, of
which only the wheels were still in a possible
state. The luggage van was replaced and
the luggage repacked. And, finally, at
nearly six o'clock, we resumed our journey
at a breakneck speed.</p>

<p>The young lady seemed rather oppressed,
probably by visions of some more terrific
accidents. Each time, when there was a
switch, the jolting caused by transferring the
carriage from one line of rails to another
seemed to send a thrill of fear through her
frame. Nevertheless, she proved a very
willing and agreeable talker. Perhaps was
she too nervous to keep silent, for I had to
inform her of the time every quarter of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hour. But she did not tell me why; whether
somebody was awaiting her, or whether there
was some particular reason for her to dread
her late arrival. Nor did I learn anything
about her. She remained clad in mystery.
After several hours' conversation I did not
know any more of her than when I had seen
her first. On the other hand, she knew all
about me and, as a matter of fact, I suppose
that it was I who did most of the talking. I
tried thus, by showing my confidence, to win
hers. But in vain.</p>

<p>At last we reached Vienna. We were
full three hours late. As she had told me
about the difficulty of getting a cab, I asked
her whether I might not go and fetch her one.</p>

<p>"Yes! She would be pleased!"</p>

<p>So, having designated a certain pillar in
the great hall, where she was to wait for me
with my bags, I went in search of a Jehu.
(I do not know whether in Vienna <i>Jehu</i>
would be an acceptable nickname, but never
mind.) It was not a very easy task, and I
had plenty of time to prepare myself for the
three questions which I absolutely must ask
her before we parted: Whether, when, and
where I should see her again. I knew that
in Vienna it was the fashion to kiss the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of a lady at such a moment. And I saw
myself already bending over her hand and
kissing it, asking her the fateful questions.</p>

<p>But, when after ten minutes I came
back, the fair Comtesse had gone. My bags
were standing lonely near the pillar and
greeted me with a mocking grin.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4"><a name="II" id="II">II.</a></h2>

<p class="pn p2">Sergeant Young gives a few
orders and then turns to me.</p>

<p>"I have read that first chapter
of your book," he says. "For a
man without any experience as a writer it
is not so bad. But, of course...."</p>

<p>Sergeant Young, my particular chum, is
the most extraordinary man of the regiment.
Take a pint each of Figaro and d'Artagnan,
half a pint of demigod, a spoonful each of
Scotchman, Frenchman, and South African,
mix well and put into khaki: You will have
Sergeant Young ready for use. Since the
beginning of the war he has been dreaming
of a commission and, my word, nobody ever
deserved one if he does not. We have been
together at the Dardanelles, and what
remains of our Division&mdash;although it is not
much&mdash;was saved by him.</p>

<p>He is a funny man. You do not know
whether he is rich or poor, for one day he has
the manner of a <i>grand seigneur</i> and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
day he is satisfied with a beggar's fare. You
cannot guess what he is in civil life. At one
moment you may take him for a broker from
the Stock Exchange, at the next for an art
critic, or a farmer, an innkeeper, an
accountant, a horsebreaker, a historian, or a
miner. We only know that he is a splendid
soldier and an excellent fellow.</p>

<p>It is in his quality of an art critic that
I have given him to read the first chapter of
my book.</p>

<p>"You see," says he, "if I were to write
a book, I would begin with the beginning."</p>

<p>"I do begin with the beginning," I
retort, "only there are some preliminary
facts which may as well be told in the course
of the narrative. I like to enter <i>in medias
res</i>."</p>

<p>"You need not swank about your
Latin," he answers. "You remind me of
the War Office. <i>They</i> (he has an undescribable
way of accentuating the word <i>they</i> when
he speaks of the War Office) <i>they</i>, too, like
young officers to get acquainted with the
'preliminary facts in the course of the
narrative'; while my opinion is: An officer
must begin with the beginning. Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
P. C., suppose you had been Holy Moses, you
would have written the Bible thus: 'God
created man in his own image, after having
created the great whales, and even at an
earlier date two great lights. I may as well
tell you that before that he had said: Let
there be light, and that at the very beginning
he had created heaven and earth.'"</p>

<p>And very sternly the Sergeant adds:</p>

<p>"I wish to know why you were in
Munich...?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to improve myself in the noble
art of composition."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me ... and why you left
it for Vienna?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you."</p>

<p><i>He</i>: "Not yet. I must hear about
another thing first. Did you miss a rat
yesterday?"</p>

<p><i>I</i> (<i>with an expression of guilt</i>): "I did."</p>

<p><i>He</i>: "I thought as much. But that
bacon was not bacon at all, and therefore
ought not to have been bad. We will find a
prompt remedy to this sort of things. Write
down what I will dictate to you."</p>

<p>I take a sheet of paper and my fountain
pen. It's one I found on the body of a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Turk, but, my word, he might have bought
a decent one before getting shot.</p>

<p class="b1">This is what the Sergeant dictates:</p>

<p class="pbq">
"To the Editor of the <i>Evening News</i>,<br />
London, E.C.<br />
"Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq10 p1">"The enemy is in our midst, and our
brave army is sold to alien scoundrels.
Some Germans have secured Government
contracts for bacon. But, of course, the
Government, which never knows what to
do when the <i>Evening News</i> has not told
them beforehand, have omitted the principal
thing. Is there a single word in these
contracts to specify that bacon must be
flesh of swine? What Tommy gets under
the designation of bacon I don't know, but
the German contractors do.</p>

<p class="pn10 reduct">"I am,</p>
<p class="pn15 reduct">"Sir,</p>
<p class="pn20 reduct">"Yours truly...."</p>

<p class="p1">"You sign," he adds.</p>

<p>"Your name?" I ask.</p>

<p>"My name? Never!" he cries.</p>

<p>His name is the one thing of which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
afraid. When he but thinks of his name
his heart sinks. His name is his secret.
He has enlisted under a false name. He calls
himself Charles Young, but in reality he is
Friedrich Wilhelm Young.</p>

<p>When my chum was born, his father was
under the influence of the deeds of the then
Crown Prince, our dearly beloved Big
Willy's dad. It was at that time the fashion
to admire, nay, to love the German. Love
is blind, and old Young called young Young:
Friedrich Wilhelm.</p>

<p>Under this name he fought in the Boer
War and climbed up the ladder from Private
to Captain, while his brother Charles only
advanced from Private to Corporal. After
the Boer War Friedrich Wilhelm went back
to ordinary civil life, and poor Charles&mdash;the
real Charles, of course&mdash;was gathered to his
people (to avoid saying crudely that he died).</p>

<p>Now, when the world skirmish began,
Friedrich Wilhelm wanted to enlist again.
But he was afraid lest his name should be
against him, and that <i>they</i>, taking him for a
German, should not give him any chance of
advancement. So he took his brother's
papers and enlisted as Corporal Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Young. The commission, he thought, would
come in time. He became Sergeant; the
commission, however, failed to come. He
did wonders, yet he did not ... succeed.</p>

<p>One day, when Lord Kitchener came to
France and had a look at his men, he saw my
friend.</p>

<p>Kitchener had a marvellous memory.
He recognized him.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Young, sir."</p>

<p>"Any relation of Captain Friedrich
Wilhelm Young, of the ......th regiment?"</p>

<p>"His brother, sir."</p>

<p>"What is he doing?"</p>

<p>"He is dead, sir."</p>

<p>"That is a great pity. He would be a
Colonel by now, I am sure. He was very
like you."</p>

<p>You cannot ask for more of a man, even
of Kitchener. Sergeant Young asked for
more, for a commission, but he did not get
it. And since that day he is vexed, displeased,
angry with his name. He positively
dreads it. He never signs anything when he
can avoid it, and if he does his signature is
illegible. Even I must not sign for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>So I put my own name at the end of the
letter to the <i>Evening News</i>, my name,
Patrick Cooper, out of which the Sergeant
has made first P. C., then Police Constable,
and finally Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>It is in the quality of Privy Councillor
that I address my chum, when suddenly a
vivid fusillade bursts forth.</p>

<p>"I say, Sergeant, don't you think we are
damn short of hand grenades?"</p>

<p>Instantly the soldier in Charles Young
awakes.</p>

<p>"How can it be possible?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you."</p>

<p>For one minute he reflects. Then,
suddenly, he bursts out:</p>

<p>"They will never learn any sense! So
many hand grenades for each hundred yards!
Whether the hundred yards are more or less
exposed, they do not care! Without you,
P. C., and me things would get desperate.
But I'll keep an eye open."</p>

<p>There he stands erect, the nostrils of his
big nose vibrating, flushed and eager, with
his air of a natural leader. One more
minute he ponders, and then:</p>

<p>"So long!" he says, and stamps away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not going to let you go out in a
rain of shrapnel like this," I cry, and try to
hold him back. But he is not to be dissuaded,
and storms out into the pelting rain
of shells and bullets. Instantly the sound
of his steps is lost in the roar of the iron
downpour.</p>

<p>I pause for a moment. What can I do?
This is such an everyday incident. Impending
death is nothing in the least extraordinary.
So, while the various sounds of war
mingle in one single note, clamorous, huge,
colossal, I resume my MS. and will tell a
few of the "preliminary facts" Sergeant
Young is so eager to know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course, I was born at Hampstead.
Sons of insurance brokers often are. You
cannot read a biography of Mozart without
finding some reference to the influence the
beautiful country of Salzburg (see first
chapter) had on his talent. I had to do with
Hampstead; Belsize Park to be exact. The
result is obvious. Mozart, when five, performed
his first concerto publicly in the hall
of the Salzburg University. I did not. Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I composed little waltzes. When six, Mozart
was so innocent and natural that, after
having played at Vienna before the Empress,
he sprang upon her lap and kissed her
heartily. I will not tell you tales and assert
that I sprang upon Queen Victoria's lap,
but I beat Mozart on one point: I published
at eight (needless to say that dad paid the
printing expenses) six sets of waltzes for the
piano, while Mozart published only two sets
of sonatas for the harpsichord and violin.</p>

<p>From this moment Mozart's life and
mine differ more and more. Mozart came to
London and lodged in Cecil Court, St.
Martin's Lane, while I went to a preparatory
school, the address of which I have forgotten.
Afterwards Mozart removed to Frith Street,
Soho, and gave concerts in the Great Hall
at Spring Gardens and at Ranelagh, while I
was sent to Harrow.</p>

<p>For years football and cricket interested
me more than music. Contrary to the usual
state of things, my mother did not believe in
my musical talent, and my father did. Why!
Had he not spent more than ¬£30 on the
printing of my waltzes (which, by the way,
remained for ten years my <i>opus</i> one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
only)? Of course they had not sold; but that
proved that I was a genius. Only potboilers
sold, in dad's mind. Had Wagner's works
sold at the beginning? A composer I was
born, and a composer I should remain.
Mother would shake her head, but father was
used to having his own way. So I had
plenty of piano lessons on the "You need not
practise to become a good pianist" method,
and at eighteen I started anew, composing
some more waltzes, of course much more
elaborate.</p>

<p>They were printed, and although they
proved once more the work of a genius, viz.:
unsaleable, I managed to make a handsome
profit on them. Daniel Cooper and Co.,
Insurance Brokers, returned to his printer,
who asked this time for ¬£44. Poor dad was
quite willing to shell out, but I found the
figure preposterous.</p>

<p>"I bet you," I declared, "that I will
get it for half the price."</p>

<p>Daniel Cooper and Co. at once handed
me a cheque for ¬£22, and after much useless
running about I had the thing printed in
Germany for ¬£11, and very nicely, too.</p>

<p>In the following two years I had several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
opportunities for similar transactions. But&mdash;I
blush in writing it down this was the
only money I made.</p>

<p>Finally mother declared that she was
sick of the whole business, that a musician
must have some sort of knowledge of his art,
that music and Hampstead were inconsistent,
and that music was not only cheaply
printed in Germany but also well taught.</p>

<p>Months, however, went by before at last
I was sent away. This delay was caused by
mother's idea, that I must go and study in
Leipzig, because my music was being printed
there, while I wished to go to Vienna, where
most of the great composers had worked and
starved.</p>

<p>Now, as I had on the one hand no wish
at all to starve and but little desire to work,
and on the other hand plenty of pocket
money, no one will be surprised to hear that
I postponed the beginning of my studies for a
few days and had a look at the city of Strauss
and Lanner. For as such Vienna appeared to
me at first, and this impression remained to
the last.</p>

<p>Of all the towns of Europe Vienna is the
Terpsichorean town. The Viennese are passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
fond of dancing, and the women,
distinguished as they are by beauty, charm,
and elegance, indulge in its pleasure even at
the cost of more solid qualities. And they
are dressed! In Paris dressing is a luxury,
in London it is a mistake, in Berlin an
impoliteness, but in Vienna it is a fine art.
Ah, the Viennese women! You must admire
them, whether you see the fashionable ladies
parading in their carriages on a May day in
the principal Avenue of the Prater, or the
jolly, boisterous girls whirling about in
October in the dancing room of one of the
village style inns where the new wine is sold.</p>

<p>And there is always the same swing of
the waltz, ever melodious, never monotonous,
the same in the large brilliant caf√©s of the
Prater as in the small, modest wine shops.</p>

<p>Oh Vienna! Town of song and dance,
where is thy happiness now?</p>

<p>How these gay, pleasure-loving, genial
people, so full of <i>bonhomie</i> and so markedly
different from the nasty inhabitants of
Berlin, could start this horrible war, is the
one thing that must astonish anybody who
knows Vienna even a little. I will say here,
that one of the reasons why I write this book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
is precisely that I believe I have an explanation
for this riddle, which seems nearly
incapable of being solved.</p>

<p>These first days of Vienna appear to my
memory as a kind of storm of jubilation, as
a tempest of laughter and cries of amusement,
of shouting and singing, of the frolicking
of light feet, of the sweet weeping of
violins.</p>

<p>And only the fact that I was living in a
very middling first-class hotel spoiled my
pleasure. It meant much money and little
comfort. It meant, too, service by the worst
waiters in the world. I don't know what
London has ever found in the German or
more correctly Austrian waiter. Happily
the war has cleared him away. And even
then a mistake, a prejudice was necessary.
For we are not rid of him because he was a
rotten waiter, but because the <i>Evening News</i>
took this creature, the most brainless in the
world, for a ... spy.</p>

<p>At least, after a week, remorse came.
Here I was, in Vienna, supposed to learn the
gentle art of music, and in reality spending
the money of Daniel Cooper and Co., Insurance
Brokers, London, E.C., on ... No! I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
not going to blush over all the details.
Besides, you have sufficient imagination to
blush for me.</p>

<p>But while I talk of blushing, I may as
well tell you that I was not found worthy of
entering the <i>conservatoire</i>. This I regretted
only because I had heard of an abundant flora
of pretty girls which was to be found there.
For every other reason private lessons
seemed to me the better way to get acquainted
with the mysteries of harmony and counter
point.</p>

<p>I enquired and my choice fell soon on a
man who, as an organist, was a local
celebrity, although he had failed to achieve
much success as a composer. His name was
Robert Hammer, he was a genius and
accordingly poor.</p>

<p>When I went to see him, I was really
shocked, so great seemed his distress. His
apartment on the top floor of a house in the
suburbs was composed of one small room.
There was a small iron bed, covered with big
parcels of manuscripts, and a baby grand
piano, also covered with music paper.
There was a plain deal table, a kitchen table
in fact, again heaped with papers, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wooden chairs which excluded all idea of
taking one's ease. The walls were hung
with an old discoloured paper, and quite
unadorned, save by a colour print representing
the old Emperor Francis Joseph.</p>

<p>The master&mdash;he was nearly seventy&mdash;seemed
exceedingly shy. He did not appear
to be greatly struck with the idea of giving
lessons to a Mozart, even to one born in
Belsize Park. He absolutely refused to
name a figure as a payment for his trouble,
and I had to name mine which, from an
insurance broker's point of view, was cheap
enough, but which evidently was a decisive
factor for a starving Viennese musician.</p>

<p>He accepted, and the lessons began.</p>

<p>How can I give you an idea of old Robert
Hammer? Imagine a sort of middle height
peasant with a flavour of a protestant
parson, the head of a Roman Emperor,
Claudius, for instance; bald, but so
bald, as to make believe that it was
an artificial baldness, an exaggerated
baldness that extended to the neck and
the temples; no beard, no moustaches, no
eyebrows. He was always dressed in black;
his trousers were shaped like those of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
British sailor, the coat ill fitting, too long
and too wide, the sleeves reaching the fingertips.
His collar was so narrow that it was
scarcely visible, and his black tie resembled
a shoe lace. As for his boots, I think it must
be he who invented the fashion of the dainty
things we wear in the trenches. He was
always rolling a little snuff between his
fingers. When he sat down to improvise on
the organ or the piano, that little snuff was
dexterously moved from the right to the left
and back to the right and again to the left,
according as the one or the other hand was
in the better position to play with three
fingers only. Of course, by degrees all the
snuff would be lost and scattered over the
keys. Then only old Hammer would do the
really impossible thing, namely, juggle away
the imaginary remains of the snuff into his
nose.</p>

<p>He was at once a genius and a perfect
fool, an old man and a baby; he possessed
all possible refinement in his art, and was
ignorant of any in life; no organist ever
reached his perfection; no musician was a
worse teacher.</p>

<p>He was a very friendly, kind man as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
long as his unbelievable absence of mind did
not interfere with his kindness. He was
one of the many types of Viennese musicians,
and I do not think that you could find in the
whole world one that would resemble him.</p>

<p>One morning, a fortnight or three weeks
after my first lesson, he inquired about the
life I was leading. And as I complained
regarding the inconveniences of hotel life, he
asked me why I should not hire a furnished
room.</p>

<p>"I have been warned," I said, "that
hotel life was still preferable to insect life."</p>

<p>He did not understand, and I had to
explain.</p>

<p>"There are not insects everywhere," he
answered. "You must know, of course,
where to stay. There is my friend Doblana
for instance, who has a very nice flat. His
wife died a year ago, and he has now one
room too many. Besides, his house would
be the right thing for you, and you would
enjoy his company. He is a musician who
plays the horn in a most charming manner.
You see, he is a Czech, and most Czechs have
thick, fleshy lips, a peculiarity which enables
them to play exceedingly well. The lips are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
most important when playing the horn. The
oldest classics did not know that. This is
the reason for their awkward writing. The
first who recognized what could be achieved
by the horn were M√©hul and Beethoven, but
Weber had to be born to invent the new
perfect language of this wonderful instrument,
the most sensual and the most chaste."</p>

<p>Mr. Doblana was forgotten, and his
furnished room too. Good old Hammer was
raving over the qualities of the horn, over
Meyerbeer's cleverness to write for it, and
over the various ways modern composers
used it, especially Wagner.</p>

<p>But if Hammer had forgotten Doblana,
I had not. The possibility of living in a
musician's decent house was too tempting,
and I decided to call upon him that very
afternoon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A rapid footstep interrupts me. It is
Sergeant Young who comes back.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Police Constable," he
says (I bet he has forgotten that my real name
is Patrick Cooper), "you need not worry
about these hand grenades, we'll have them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in half a mo. I've blackmailed the colonel
in the most shameless way, but I've
succeeded."</p>

<p>He takes my MS. and reads the second
chapter.</p>

<p>"That will never do," he says after a
while. "If you mix up our trench business
with your Austrian affairs, how do you hope
that the reader will find his way?"</p>

<p>"He will muddle through."</p>

<p>"No publisher will accept it in this
form."</p>

<p>"Well, he will have it edited. Editors
must live."</p>

<p>The Sergeant sees that there is nothing
to be done, and goes on reading.</p>

<p>"You did not say why you left Munich,"
he remarks at last.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I answer lightly, "because I
had a ticket for Vienna."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">III.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">That afternoon, as I had decided,
I went to the Karlsgasse, where
Mr. Doblana lived. My hotel
being rather a long way from
his address I took a <i>fiaker</i>, the most
graceful two-horse carriage you can imagine.
<i>Fiakers</i> are well-known for their jolly cabbies.
Was it their fame which made me look
at this one, or was it his face that attracted
me? I cannot tell, but when I did look at
him, I was startled. For I knew the man,
or thought so for a moment. He was at
once alike to the irascible Frenchman whom
Destiny had obliged to make room for the
fair Comtesse (see chapter one), and to the
conductor who soon afterwards had accepted
a backsheesh for certain services. But he
seemed a little younger and had that special
low class smartness which distinguishes the
Viennese cabman. So I concluded that
after all this was only a coincidence. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it was extraordinary that I should
see in so short time three people having the
same black hair, the same black moustache
and pointed tuft of beard on their chin, and,
above all, the same somewhat mocking
expression on their features.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the Karlsgasse, I was
still so impressed with my cabbie, that I had
a feeling, when I first saw Mr. Doblana, that
he too was greatly alike to somebody I knew.
The funniest thing is that really he did
resemble someone; but at this first meeting
I could not possibly remember who it was.</p>

<p>I found an elderly refined man with an
exceedingly sorrowful expression in his face.
This expression was increased by his speech.
He pronounced his German with a Czech
accent, which makes people speak with a
kind of sad sing-song. Many Slavs always
seem to talk as if they were making a visit
of condolence.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Doblana was really mourning.
And I had to hear with some details the
story of Mrs. Doblana, whom he had lost a
year ago. She had been first a comic-opera
singer, and later had earned good money by
giving singing lessons. This made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
understand how it was possible that a horn-player,
even a first horn-player at the
Imperial Opera, could afford such a fine flat.
For it was, indeed, a handsome apartment.</p>

<p>The knowledge of its disposition, reader
dear, has some importance for the understanding
of events which I will relate to you
in due course. The simplest thing would be
to draw a plan of the apartment, but, somehow,
I am too proud to fight against my
incapacity as a draughtsman, and I remember
that Conan Doyle always rises up to
circumstances when the question is the
description of some locality. Then, why
shouldn't I?</p>

<p>You know that in a decently built
English house you can get out from any
room direct to the hall or a landing. In
Vienna it is otherwise. The finer the apartment
and the greater the number of rooms,
the less opportunity of getting out of them
directly into the ante-room. The inconvenience
is really ideal.</p>

<p>In addition to the entrance door there
were but two doors in Mr. Doblana's hall,
one leading to the front rooms, the other to
the back rooms. In front there were four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The one entered when coming from the hall
was the <i>salon</i>, to its right was situated what
was destined to be my room, where until her
mother's death Miss Doblana had lived. To
the left of the <i>salon</i> there was first the
musician's room and then his daughter's,
the last of the four, which had belonged in
times gone by to Mrs. Doblana. The
widower evidently had not been able to bear
the emptiness of her apartment. This was
the reason why Miss Doblana now lived
there. At present she was rather unwell
and confined to her room.</p>

<p>I would certainly be all right and have
my own privacy, said Mr. Doblana; I would
have a latch-key, and through the <i>salon</i>
could get in and out of the flat without
disturbing anybody. Nor would I be disturbed
if I wanted to work. Miss Doblana
had singing lessons, she was taking them
at her master's house. At home, in the
drawing room, she practised only for half
an hour a day. I might dispose of the
piano all the rest of the time.</p>

<p>I declared that I was not much of a
worker, (little did I suspect that I was to
compose in the Karlsgasse at Vienna the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
only score of any importance and value
which I ever have written and am likely to
write). If Mr. Doblana, whom I knew to
be a distinguished composer, wanted the
piano I would certainly not drive him away.</p>

<p>My host, visibly flattered by the "distinguished
composer," led me out into the
ante-room and from there into the back rooms
of his flat. There was a dining room
and his studio, and further away the kitchen
and the maid's room.</p>

<p>"It is here," said Mr. Doblana, when
we entered his studio, "that I used to have
my happiest hours. Here I compose, without
any instrument. It is very rare that I
go to the piano and try an effect, and when
I do it at all, it is really only from laziness,
or as a little relaxation."</p>

<p>What a difference between Doblana's
snug little studio and Hammer's poverty-stricken
abode! And yet, Hammer was a
genius, who played the organ at St.
Stephen's as nobody perhaps ever did, but
played it <i>gratis pro Deo</i> (literally to understand!)
He used to say: "Even old
Hammer must have some pleasure from time
to time, and he gets it when he plays at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Stephen's; and even God, to Whom all
people, including myself, come lamenting
and complaining, even God must have a little
pleasure from time to time, and He gets it
too when Hammer plays at St. Stephen's.
Now, why should I accept any money? Is
it for my pleasure or for His?"</p>

<p>As for Doblana, the little I know I owe
to him, and not to old Hammer; but this
does not in the least prevent me from
recognizing the insipidity of the pretty tunes
he used to write for his ballets which were
performed at the Opera, the slight ballets at
the Grand Opera, out of which he succeeded
in making quite a decent amount of money.
Nor did he play the horn for the love of
God. He was a resourceful man, Anton
Doblana, he had his salaries at the Opera,
at the Imperial Chapel, and at the Conservatoire,
he had his royalties, and for
some time he had me.</p>

<p>"You will be quite well here," he
assured me when I took leave, "and mind
you, I am not always such a peevish fellow
as I am now. I am upset because of a very
ugly occurrence that befell me some time
ago. I hope I will forget soon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>What had happened to him, he did not
tell me, and I went away, glad to have
secured quarters which seemed to be almost
the ideal thing. And I still wondered where
I could have known an individual so like
him that I always had the impression of
having seen Doblana before.</p>

<p>The next day, when I moved in, Fanny,
the maid, a fair plump little object, showed
me in. She was a young chatterbox, but a
friendly one. Mr. Doblana was out, and
<i>Fr√§ulein</i> was not visible; but she, Fanny,
would make me comfortable, which she did
in fact with much obligingness. In consequence
she was tipped accordingly.</p>

<p>You see, I was not what one may call
spoiled. Only a year before, when I had
been staying for a month with the Dickses
at Bedford (Dicks senior is an intimate
friend of the senior partner of Daniel
Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd., and has an only
daughter, besides a fine estate at Bedford),
well, I was also shown in by a housemaid,
but who treated me as if she were a duchess,
which perhaps she was, and who carried the
hot water for my use as if she were the
Archbishop of Canterbury going to anoint
the King. (By the way: God save him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
give him victory!)&mdash;Now, if I had tipped
that Midland goddess with gold, why should
I not make friends with plain Fanny on a
silver basis?</p>

<p>Fanny kissed my hand and I felt silly.
I was not yet used to the shameless way in
which Viennese people of the lower class
throw themselves on any hand they may
think kissable, viz.: capable of kissing back,
the kiss of a hand being hard, round, and
having a metallic sound when you let it
fall.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that two crown piece conquered
Fanny. Parents, when reading this,
should not feel incensed because of the
extravagance of their children. An Austrian
crown is worth less than a shilling, and in
stating this I do not think only of the
Imperial crown.&mdash;When, an hour later, I
left to take my lesson with old Hammer, my
things were in order, and all I could do was
heroically to resist my wish to tip Fanny
again when I asked her to oil my door, which
was creaking badly.</p>

<p>You know that to go out I had to cross
the <i>salon</i>. As I was halfway through it,
the door opposite mine, the one which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
leading to Mr. Doblana's room, was suddenly
closed. Perhaps my opening the door of my
own room had caused a draught, Vienna
being always a windy place, and thus the
opposite door had been slammed. But
instinctively I felt that there was something
else. Miss Doblana, who was, may
be, not so unwell as it pleased her father to
say, had had, no doubt, a fit of curiosity and
had watched me. I imagined that, her hair
being adorned with hair-curlers (I did not
know then that this achievement of Western
civilisation had not yet reached oriental
Vienna), she had rapidly hidden herself from
my attention.</p>

<p>I ought to tell you that this was quite
unnecessary. There were plenty of nice
girls in Vienna whom I had leisure to look
at, but somehow I had no mind for them.
Much less for a spinster who, to judge from
her father's age, was probably ten years my
elder and wore hair-curlers. In fact, I had
not been able to forget my fair Comtesse of
Salzburg fame; and I lived in an unceasing
hope that I might see her again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A voice to my right calls my name. But
there is no-one to my right. And then a
shout of laughter resounds to my left. It
is Private Pringle, who in civil life is a
ventriloquist and enjoys playing such tricks.
So do we. To-day he plays beside this the
part of a postman, and he has a letter for
me. It is from Daniel Cooper and consort.
The consort treats me as a naughty boy,
because I write so little, and could I not tell
her some pretty story about the war? And
whether I was careful and avoided these
wicked shells?</p>

<p>The pater wants to know whether some
music paper would be welcome; I ought to
write a good military march, so that English
soldiers could at last stop playing Austrian
marches.</p>

<p>And both of them tell me that Bean was
simply dying with anxiety for me. Bean
is Violet Dicks. She hates flower names
and prefers to be a vegetable. In war time
evidently vegetables have a greater value
than flowers, but she had already had this
mad idea in peace time, from the very day
when her tiny brain awoke to wisdom. And
yet, she is in love with me. If she knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that I am writing the story of another girl!
No, little Bean, no! Anyhow, not yet&mdash;if
ever! And so I return to Vienna.</p>

<p>I had made a rule of going every evening
to a theatre. The theatres are beautiful,
and the performances generally excellent.
This evening, the first day of my stay at the
Karlsgasse, I went to the <i>Burg</i> theatre to
see <i>Macbeth</i>. I had arranged with Mr.
Doblana that we should meet at a certain
caf√© after the performance.</p>

<p>I found him there sitting at a large
round table amongst his friends, a
dozen or more, who were all actors,
or artists, or belonged in some fashion
to the theatrical world. One of them
was an officer, but seemed nevertheless
to belong to the company. They called him
"<i>Herr Graf</i>." Doblana was sitting to his
left and seemed to have kept a place next to
himself for me.</p>

<p>I had, on my journey to Vienna, stopped
in various towns in Germany, here for a few
days, there for a few weeks, and had been
introduced to some such companies. But
while in Germany women were admitted,
actresses mostly, we were only men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Vienna. This may account for the fact that
the conversation was generally much more
of a serious character. There was but one
individual, a Hungarian, who with a loud
and discordant voice told funny yarns and
tried to attract the general attention. He
was a theatrical agent, named Maurus
Giulay, and remarkable by the quantity of
black hair which grew in his nose instead of
on his head, and by the amount of diamonds
which adorned his coarse, greasy fingers.
His stomach was rather protuberant. So
was a roll of fat that protruded beyond the
back of his collar. He displeased me
intensely, and I took an immediate dislike
to him.</p>

<p>Not knowing anybody present I took no
part in the conversation. Besides, I was
not acquainted with the subjects which were
being discussed. So it happened that
keeping quiet, from no choice of my own, I
overheard a part of the dialogue which just
was taking place between Doblana and the
<i>Herr Graf</i>.... My host was entreating his
neighbour not to take a certain matter as
lightly as he did.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "your share is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
large as mine, so should your interest be!"</p>

<p>"If it is a question of money," retorted
the other, "although I don't owe you anything,
you know that you may count on any
compensation from me for the ill-luck which
has befallen you."</p>

<p>"I know that you are always generous,"
answered Doblana, "and I thank you from
my heart. But it is not a question of money.
Think only: the result of a full year's work,
and it has been announced to the press..."</p>

<p>"You know that I was always against
this announcement."</p>

<p>"I know it and deplore it. For this is
the explanation of your indifference now.
You had taken a prejudice against the thing.
But should it therefore be lost altogether?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the <i>Herr Graf</i> haughtily,
"I do not care, and I have heard enough of
the whole affair."</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Doblana looked very
distressed and assumed an air of an even
more unspeakable sadness than that which I
had noticed when I first had seen him.</p>

<p>At this moment a new guest arrived,
evidently a popular knight of this Round
Table, for they were all eager to shake hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with him. If he was not King Arthur himself,
he was nevertheless something very near
to this exalted personage, namely, Vienna's
most celebrated actor, Alfred Bischoff.</p>

<p>The table was rather full, however he
managed to squeeze himself between Doblana
and me. As he did so, he uttered some
words of apology. I had not recognized
this clean shaven man with his heavy eyelids
and deep drawn features, but I recollected
at once his incomparable voice. If I am not
much of a musician, after all, I have at
least good ears, a minor detail for a composer,
when you think of Beethoven.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bischoff," I cried, "I have just
had one of the greatest experiences one can
imagine: your Macbeth. How happy I am
to make your acquaintance!"</p>

<p>He looked at me.</p>

<p>"You are an Englishman," he said,
which made me think that if all was said my
accent must be more pronounced than my
vanity would have wished; yet, though
vexed, I answered in a meek affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then," he continued, "there is no
danger of your being an Anti-Semite and of
your withdrawing your admiration once you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
have heard from Alfred Bischoff himself,
that he is neither a bishop, nor even a
Christian at all, but a simple Jew named
Aaron Cohn."</p>

<p>The <i>Herr Graf</i> distorted his features a
little.</p>

<p>"You see," went on the great actor,
"our friend Alphons Hector ..." and he
nodded at the <i>Herr Graf</i>, "smells something
like sulphur. After all he would like to
have me burned." And he added laughing:
"It's in the blood, <i>Herr Graf</i>, and it cannot
be helped. And to think that you are the
best of the lot!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bischoff&mdash;for I prefer to call him by
this name which he has made so celebrated&mdash;turned
to me and said:</p>

<p>"You English are a great nation.
Freedom is your motto. Freedom in everything&mdash;freedom
even in religion. A Jew,
with you, is as complete a human being as
a Christian. You have no Anti-Semitism."</p>

<p>"May I take it," I asked him, "that
there is a little gratitude in your masterly
interpretation of our Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"No," replied he, "not in the least.
Our art is art for art's sake. And if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
succeed in rendering Shakespeare's meaning,
it is due to our possessing good translations
of his works."</p>

<p>"That may be," I declared, "but then
the German tongue is so suitable to translations."</p>

<p>At once he flew up in a rage. And the
same man who just had called us a great
nation used the most abusive terms against
us.</p>

<p>"As if any tongue were unsuitable to
translations. But, of course, with you,
with mean shopkeepers, with you and your
mercenary point of view, how could you have
good translations? I have been asked by
one of your English firms to translate an
English play, a rotten one, of course. 'We
usually pay seven and sixpence a thousand
words,' they wrote, 'but in consideration of
your fame, we would pay anything up to ten
shillings a thousand.' As if this could be a
decisive factor! As if it were not before all
necessary to be inspired by the original!
And it has always been like that. A workman's
pay for a workman's job, while translating
in reality is the most difficult occupation
in literature. Do you know who translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<i>Macbeth</i> into German? Wieland, a
classic, Voss, a classic, Schiller, a classic,
and finally Schlegel and Tieck, two classics,
whose translation you have heard this
evening. Goethe translated the tragedies of
Voltaire and novels by Diderot and Cellini's
memoirs. And Schiller translated Virgil
and a Greek tragedy, and Racine's <i>Phaedra</i>,
and French and Italian comedies. Do you
think they did it for seven and sixpence a
thousand words or even for ten shillings?
No! They did it out of enthusiasm, out of
the one feeling which creates everything
great in art. They thought theirs a holy
mission, and thus, amongst other things,
they originated the art of translating. For
translating is an art with us, while it is pot-boiling
with you."</p>

<p>He remained silent for a minute or so.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said then a little more composedly,
"we have excellent translations of
<i>Macbeth</i>, wonderful translations. Yet we
do not know how to play it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked rather
astonished.</p>

<p class="b1">"For instance," he replied, "when in
the first act the witches say to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq1">'All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!<br />
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!<br />
All hail, Macbeth! thou shalt be king hereafter!'</p>

<p class="p1 b1">the stage manager this evening made some
noise with a gong and destroyed that moment
of great impression, into which Banquo is
to murmur:</p>

<p class="ppq1">'Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear<br />
Things that do sound so fair?'</p>

<p class="p1">Indeed, I had seemed to start, not because
of the prophecy, but because of the gong.
And Klein who, God knows, is a fine actor,
was obliged to speak his words aloud instead
of murmuring them. The scene was spoiled.
And so it went through the whole evening.
The entire tragedy is a tissue of terror, of
trembling, of anxious forebodings, of dreadful
silence, and it was torn into rags this
evening. But the worst of all was the Lady
Macbeth."</p>

<p class="b1">Poor me! How difficult it seemed to
satisfy Mr. Bischoff. I had thought the
performance extraordinary. I had been so
much impressed by the mysterious way in
which the whole thing had been played. At
one moment I had not been able to distinguish
whether Macbeth had sighed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
whether the night wind had howled in the
chimney. Everything had seemed to me to
be but one soul. When Macbeth after the
murder had come and looked at his bloody
hands and had muttered:</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">'This is a sorry sight.'</p>

<p class="p1">I had felt as though I had done the deed
myself with him. And Lady Macbeth! How
dreadful she had been, especially in the
dream scene.</p>

<p class="b1">"Lady Macbeth!" went on Mr. Bischoff,
"of course, it is Goethe who made the great,
fatal mistake when he called her a superwitch.
Our actresses make a monster of
her. I did not feel seduced by our Lady
Macbeth this evening. She ought to flatter,
to cajole me. She ought to be a beautiful,
flexible cat, she ought to be trembling with
love and to shudder herself before her awful
thoughts and words. And at the end, when
she walks in her sleep, I don't want her to
come and to declaim. I want her to be ill
and feverish and weak, weak as a child, yes,
as a child. I want her to say in a childish,
soft voice:</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">
'Yet here's a spot.'</p>

<p class="p1 b1">and I want her to weep when she says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq10">'Who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?'</p>

<p class="p1">I want her to be a broken, ruined woman,
and I want you, the spectator, to pity her."</p>

<p>I listened surprised, for what he said
seemed true to me.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," he went on. "You
are a composer, or will be one. There has
never been a more splendid task for a
musician than to write a musical drama on
<i>Macbeth</i>, to express all that the poet left
untold, to show this couple of criminals as
poor human beings, to change their poison
into tears."</p>

<p>The next day I was quite full of these
ideas: they satiated my brain. <i>Macbeth&mdash;Macbeth,
an opera</i>&mdash;an opera by Patrick
Cooper, an opera with original Scotch tunes,
perhaps with bagpipes, an opera with a Lady
Macbeth full of charm instead of full of
hideousness, an opera with strange mysterious
sounds.... For the first time I thought
that I was understanding Hammer's extraordinary
theory, that there were no harmonies,
but only voices....</p>

<p>I think I was a ridiculous youth then.
Anyhow, I like myself better in khaki. And,
strange to say, the music I hear now, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
roar of the guns, has its fearful beauty, too.</p>

<p>I believe the editor will cancel this. Of
course it is not easy to write a book in such
surroundings. I should like to see you
trying to do it. Sometimes I admire myself.
But then I have only to think of the man
who works at the chemistry treatise, and you
ought to see how bashful I can become.</p>

<p>Well, to return to my subject, the day
after <i>Macbeth</i> rather resembled its predecessor,
for in the morning I was again
watched through the partly opened door,
and in the evening I went to the opera, where
they played <i>Tannh√§user</i>. Mr. Doblana had
given me a ticket so that I might hear him
blowing his part.</p>

<p>On the evening before Mr. Bischoff had
been far from enthusiastic about <i>Macbeth</i>.
I tried to imitate him re <i>Tannh√§user</i>. I
did not think the performance very extraordinary.
Venus ought to have had more
charm, and her pink chemise (or was it a
dress robe?) did not provide the illusion I
was looking for. Tannh√§user was rather
elderly and seemed not to have understood
the problem of sacred love <i>versus</i> profane
love. And he treated Venus as though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
had been his "Missus," and Elizabeth as
though she had been his "fancy lady"; and
yet it was Venus who was the "fancy lady."
But the worst was Elizabeth. She was a
beautiful, fair wig, large and wavering, with
a stately lady in front; the whole had a
strong voice, which wavered too. I had
always imagined Elizabeth as a young girl
with long rich plaits thrown in front of her
over her shoulders, a girl, nice and pure and
not yet womanly at all. While the one I
saw seemed to be an aunt of the Landgrave,
and not his niece.</p>

<p>Mr. Doblana and I met again after the
performance. But we had only a hasty
supper at a restaurant before we went home.
For it was already late, and the horn-player
had a heavy rehearsal before him which was
to begin at ten o'clock next morning.</p>

<p>The house was very quiet when we
arrived. Midnight was just striking at the
Karl's Church. There was not a sign of
life. In the <i>salon</i> a tiny flame of gas was
burning. We parted wishing each other a
good night; Mr. Doblana extinguished the
little gas flame and went into his room, I
into mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>There I lit my chandelier. As I did so
I noticed well in evidence on my table an
envelope bearing my name. I did not know
the writing, which was thin and pointed, a
woman's hand. I tore the envelope open.
Inside, on a half-sheet of paper, were
written the words: "Do not bolt your door
this night." There was no signature.</p>

<p>Now, please, darling reader, imagine
my feelings.</p>

<p>There I was in a strange house and in
a strange town, where I had no feminine
acquaintances. (I beg Fanny's pardon, but
as I had tipped her but the day before, she
did not count.) And there was a female
bidding me not to bolt my door.</p>

<p>Imagine further, that I had slept little
the night before, the sitting at the caf√©
having lasted long, up to the small hours.
Imagine that the whole day I had mentally
worked hard on <i>Macbeth</i>, an opera in five
acts by Patrick Cooper. Imagine also that
I had heard an expanded, tiring performance
of <i>Tannh√§user</i> and that I felt sleepy and
little disposed for receiving visits. But
fancy also that I was twenty-one and
thirsting for adventures; yet that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
clever enough to guess that the lady who
wished to see me was that elderly spinster,
Miss Doblana, with her curler-pins, a detail
which made the adventure less desirable.
Think of all that, and then of an idea which
occurred to my shrewd brain, namely, that,
after all, it was perhaps not Miss Doblana
who wanted that nocturnal interview, for in
that case she would have to cross her father's
room. That, therefore, the mysterious lady
was hidden in one of the backrooms whither
she must have penetrated with the help of
Fanny. That there was but one lady who
could have sufficient interest in my whereabouts
to have taken the trouble of finding
out where I was staying; one, the Comtesse!
For as I had told her the name of the hotel
where I was going to stay, and as I had left
my new address when I departed from the
said hotel, nothing was more natural and
easy than to find me. But nothing was more
unnatural than to call upon me in the middle
of the night. No! it was not the Comtesse,
It was the daughter of my horn-player.</p>

<p>There was another dilemma. Should I
take off my boots? Was it possible to await
a lady at such an hour in slippers? I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
not much experience in affairs of that sort.</p>

<p>In my despair I used bad language,
threw myself into an easy chair and took
my Shakespeare. Destiny had made me
take it with me when I left Hampstead.
Since this morning it had been lying on the
table, in case of emergencies. I opened it
and started reading <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>Then a funny thing happened. Lady
Macbeth was no longer present at the famous
banquet, but she presided in the equally
famous hall over a competition of Scotch
bards, who tried to play Wagner on their
bagpipes. As they did not succeed the
Landgrave said most rudely: "Go to ...
Venus!" whereupon they all disappeared.
Lady Macbeth in the same moment became
the fair Landgravine Elizabeth, but not the
one I had seen at the Opera this evening, for
she had two beautiful plaits thrown over her
shoulders and falling upon her bosom,
exactly as I had wished it, and she was
young and uncommonly pretty. She carried
a taper which allowed me to see the funniest
detail, namely, a certain likeness, to whom
do you think, wise reader? To the Comtesse.</p>

<p>Some slight noise made me start, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Shakespeare tumbled down to the floor.
Near the door, with a candle in her hand,
exactly as Lady Macbeth ought to come in
the dream scene, a forlorn child&mdash;and exactly
dressed as I had wished Elizabeth to be
dressed, in a long white gown, with long,
rich, fair plaits falling on her bosom&mdash;there
stood my Comtesse. As she saw me awakening
from my dream, she put her left forefinger
on her thick, fleshy lips and whispered
anxiously:</p>

<p>"Don't talk aloud."</p>

<p>I wanted to take her light, to press, nay!
to kiss her hands, but she prevented it.</p>

<p>"I have come," she said, "to ask you,
whatever might happen, not to tell my father
that you met me at Salzburg."</p>

<p>"I promise that, Miss Doblana...."</p>

<p>You see, clever reader, I had grasped the
situation quite as quickly as you, I had
realized who the mysterious person was to
whom Mr. Doblana was so greatly alike, that
it had struck me on my first visit at the
Karlsgasse; I had devined that SHE was
neither a Comtesse, nor an elderly spinster
with hair-curlers, nor Lady Macbeth, nor
even the Landgravine as I had wished her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
but Miss Doblana, who was apparently not
as ill as her father had told me, yet very
pale.</p>

<p>"I promise, but why?"</p>

<p>This "Why" was not precisely chivalrous,
and you might even call it indiscreet,
but Miss Doblana evidently expected the
question.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," she replied,
"my father has a long rehearsal at the
opera. He leaves here at a quarter to ten
and will not be home before two. I will be
in the <i>salon</i> the whole time during his
absence. If you wish it I will then tell you
all."</p>

<p>It was said in the faintest whisper.
Without a sound she opened the door and
disappeared. Not even the door creaked.
Fanny had done her duty.</p>

<p>But was it Fanny?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">IV.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">How long have I been writing? I
don't know. But there is
Sergeant Young coming back.</p>

<p>"You had better get ready,"
he says, "there is going to be an attack.
The Germans are coming over this way."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I answer quietly and begin
preparing myself.</p>

<p>"I dare say," goes on the Sergeant,
"that the Germans are very Hun-wise. It
will be a Hun-pleasant job for them."</p>

<p>When he starts on those puns it is a sign
that he is in a good temper.</p>

<p>"If they think that they will get Hun-perturbed
into our trenches, they make a
Hun-believable mistake. These trenches are
Hun-approachable."</p>

<p>But time passes, ten minutes, twenty
minutes, and no order comes. You cannot
imagine how bored one is during the long
hours of waiting between attacks, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
anxiety which precedes the moments of real
danger makes up for these weary intervals.</p>

<p>"Have you written something more?"
finally asks Charlie.</p>

<p>Silently I offer him the sheets, and he
begins to read. Meanwhile I am thinking
that I ought to write to dad and tell him
that I cannot compose a march in the
trenches because of the booming of the guns
which will never keep time&mdash;and to mamma
that nothing was easier than to avoid the
shells; she need not know that they cannot
always avoid us&mdash;and to Bean, that there
was no reason for anxiety at all, war being
only an exaggerated picnic and casualties
some sort of indigestion.</p>

<p>"I say," declares Sergeant Young, who
has read the chapter in less time than was
necessary, "I say, your Miss Doblana
behaves in a rather Hun-maidenly manner.
To call in the middle of the night upon a
young, Hun-married man, with her hair
Hun-done! I am afraid the public will find
it Hun-conventional and even Hun-pardonable.
Of course, she was in love with the
pretty Salzburg officer."</p>

<p>"You jump to conclusions. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
think that anything in my story may have
suggested that."</p>

<p>"In this case, what did you think of
her visit?"</p>

<p>"I thought ... that she had been obliged
to go across her father's room, and that she
would not have done so without some necessity.
Her fear had been great, to judge
from her wide eyes and her paleness. Would
she have undergone any risk if there had
been some chance of avoiding it?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;if it was Hun-avoidable!
And what did you feel?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think that I felt very
happy? Certainly, there was joy in my
knowledge of having found her again.
There was also, as I have written, a desire
to kiss her beautiful hands. But, above all,
above my surprise, my joy, and my desire,
there was apprehension lest her father
should have noticed her absence, lest her
step, in spite of its lightness, should have
been audible in the deep silence of the night.
What would I have done if the door had
opened and the sad, old man had appeared
and reproached me with having violated his
hospitality?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see. You had a little chilliness, like
when you heard the bullets whistling around
you for the first time and felt the wind
caused by the shells. It's a bit Hun-canny
and one shivers a little, but one goes on.
Did you?"</p>

<p>"I did. But it was not an easy affair.
For, to begin with, the next morning our
interview was spoiled. It was the first time
since my arrival in his house that Doblana
was to be absent for several hours. And,
while on the two previous days he had left
the door of his room open, this time he had
locked his daughter in. I waited in the
<i>salon</i> for a good while, in vain."</p>

<p>"It must have been Hun-comfortable."</p>

<p>"At last I heard a little noise at Mr.
Doblana' s door, as though some small dog
were scratching at it. And a piece of note
paper was pushed through the split at the
bottom of the door into the <i>salon</i>. At once
I rushed forth to it. As I came to the door
I heard a well-known voice, <i>her v</i>oice, talking
through the door."</p>

<p>"'Is that you Mr. Cooper?'&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'Are
you alone?'&mdash;'Yes.'&mdash;'Can you open
this door?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tried. It was locked.</p>

<p>"'I cannot.'&mdash;'Nor can I. Take the
letter I have pushed under the door. Read
it and then destroy it. Good-bye.'</p>

<p class="b1">"I tried to talk more, but there was no
answer. So I read the letter. It ran something
like this:</p>

<p class="pbq">'My father has locked me in. I can
tell you nothing through the door. But
you may trust Fanny. She will do anything
for a tip. I have no money, but you
have.'</p>

<p class="p1">
And it was signed Mitzi D."<br />
</p>

<p>I look at the Sergeant. He seems no
more interested in my story than if I were
preaching a sermon in a Sunday School.
Of course, I keep the sequel to myself,
namely, how Fanny and I conspired to call
in a locksmith who promised to make a key
within two hours, but forgot to tell us that
these two hours were to begin only three days
later. Punctuality is a virtue of which no
workman ever wishes to pride himself, not
even in Austria.</p>

<p>The Sergeant has an air as though he
were dreaming, an absent-minded air which
he sometimes assumes. When he is visionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
like that, nothing can make him follow
other people's thoughts. But he makes no
secrets of his ideas, and sooner or later we
learn what is in his mind. So I wait in the
respectful silence a Lance-Corporal owes to
his superior officer.</p>

<p>Suddenly he jumps up.</p>

<p>"P.C.," he cries, "I firmly believe that
I will get my commission to-day!"</p>

<p>It was about time he did get it! Thrice
already he has purchased an officer's kit.
Twice he has lost it. Let us hope that the
third will serve.</p>

<p>"And whence does that belief come?"
I ask him.</p>

<p>"I told you that I got a supplementary
lot of hand grenades by blackmailing the
Colonel. Well, it has occurred to me that I
might try the same trick for obtaining my
commission. Where protection, ability, and
courage have failed, blackmailing might
succeed."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answer somewhat doubtfully,
"but how will you blackmail him?"</p>

<p>"That," he declares solemnly, "is of
course a secret between him and me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Reader will understand me, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
state that I grew curious.</p>

<p>"Is there a woman at the bottom of it?"</p>

<p>You ought to have heard the Sergeant's
fit of laughter. He does not laugh very
often, our Charlie, but when he does, it is the
noisiest laugh in the world. Develish we call
it. It is indeed a terrific laughter, long and
irresistible. Finally, however, he will be
able to utter some words. This time he
says:</p>

<p>"No! Dear me, no! There wasn't a
woman at the bottom of it&mdash;no! There was
something quite different!"</p>

<p>At this moment the order comes, the
order which we had been waiting for during
an hour. In single file we march through
the communication trenches.</p>

<p>Now, if you think, impatient reader,
that I will annoy you with a detailed
description of the attack, you are greatly
mistaken. Firstly, you have doubtless read
many such descriptions in the papers and do
not want another. Secondly, I could not
depict the attack, because I had another
business than that of observing, Lance-Corporals
not being, generally, Special Correspondents.
Finally, you have no idea how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
easily one forgets the details. They are
rapidly dimmed in the fog of war.</p>

<p>Yet I remember the Germans coming
very near us and being beaten back. And I
remember, too, the following incidents:</p>

<p>On our way the Sergeant tells me that it
is to-day two years since he saw <i>Parsifal</i> in
London, which he declares being not only a
Hun-palatable, tedious work, but also a
Hun-Christian one mocking the Mass and
acceptable only from the Hun's point of
view, as Pan-Germanic propaganda. Whereupon
we hear from somewhere the bells of
the holy Grail ringing. It is Pringle, the
ventriloquist, who provides them, of course.</p>

<p>Cotton, the chemist, who enjoys quite
naturally the nickname Guncotton, and who
habitually speaks a special language nobody
can understand (for it is crammed with
chemical formulas), starts a great sniffing
performance. At last he declares that there
is a distinct scent of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and wonders,
wonders, wonders.</p>

<p>Nor is his astonishment incomprehensible.
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is sulphuric acid, and what
he smells is in reality cabbages being cooked
somewhere in a neighbouring trench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on I remember our throwing hand grenades.
The Sergeant is very clever at
that game, which he accompanies with fits
of his devilish laughter. When a shell
bursts near us without hurting anybody, he
laughs again, rather imitating the laughter
of Mephisto in the third act of <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>The Colonel is quite near us, and Charlie
by his side. There is a periscope and the
Colonel can see whatever we achieve.</p>

<p>The Sergeant throws another hand
grenade.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" he laughs,
"one more Hun Hun-done!"</p>

<p>"That was a nice one," states the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"What of my commission, Sir?" risks
Charlie.</p>

<p>But he has no luck. In the same
moment the Colonel's periscope is smashed
by some unkind shell. Spontaneously
Charles Young laughs.</p>

<p>The Colonel, who is no coward, at once
climbs up the parapet.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, sir?" cries
Charlie.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll be killed in a jiffy!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"But that's madness! Come back!"</p>

<p>The Colonel shouts something which we
cannot understand in the noise, probably
"Shut up!" and stands there amidst the
bullets which are immediately directed at
him.</p>

<p>"You damn fool!" thunders Charlie,
"will you come down?"</p>

<p>This time the Colonel turns round and
shouts so strongly that I can hear the words:</p>

<p>"You will be court-martialled for
that!"</p>

<p>But in the next instant Charlie runs up
to him:</p>

<p>"I don't care! And if you don't come
down at once I'll tell the company your
secret."</p>

<p>He has caught the Colonel's arm and
drags him down to relative safety. And
another fit of laughter follows.</p>

<p>I wonder. Has he won his commission
or decidedly lost it? But there is no time
for wondering. A big shell, a Jack Johnson,
falls in our trench. There is a terrific
explosion, and I see Charlie thrown up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the air, three or four yards up, and coming
back.</p>

<p>No one else is wounded, although we
were all shaking a bit. Even the Colonel.</p>

<p>There he lies, my chum, my Charlie,
quite pale, white as a corpse, save for the
blood that covers his big nose. Somebody
bends over him and says:</p>

<p>"Some water, quick!"</p>

<p>Off runs Guncotton shouting:</p>

<p>"H<sub>2</sub>O!"</p>

<p>But after a minute he comes back with
real water. Nobody utters a word while
poor Charlie's nose is washed. At last the
Colonel, much affected, says:</p>

<p>"He has finished swearing and laughing.
Poor fellow, he has at last met his
fate."</p>

<p>And solemnly&mdash;for he is a very religious
man&mdash;he adds:</p>

<p>"May the Lord have mercy upon his
soul."</p>

<p>Now, is it the Colonel's speech that
rouses him, or is it the effect of the fresh
water? But the answer comes at once:</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" says the Sergeant, "I am
quite Hun-hurt!" and laughs once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
"Where am I? In hell?"</p>

<p>The Colonel takes flight, although, I
repeat it, he is no coward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am back in my trench, and the time for
being bored has come once more. So I
return to Vienna and to Mitzi Doblana, with
apologies to Bean in case of her ever reading
this book.</p>

<p>I think you will have noticed the great
difficulty I experienced in meeting Miss
Mitzi. First I suffered from a closed door
and then from a locksmith of remarkable
punctuality. When at last I had secured
the key, which was to be not only the means
of opening that hostile door but also of
solving a mystery, my landlord had no long
rehearsal for another couple of days. Thus
nearly a week had passed since I had had
her promise of an interview, and in all these
days there arose not the slightest opportunity
of catching a glimpse of her.</p>

<p>Now, if you have the least idea of the
peculiar qualities of a young man's heart,
you will know that such waiting is the right
thing to inflame it, namely, the heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Therefore, when finally we met, fancy my joy
as I saw her advancing towards me and presenting
me one of those beautiful hands of
hers with a sweet: "At last!"</p>

<p>Yes, at last! At last she let me kiss
her hand&mdash;as was due to me since that Sunday
evening when she had abandoned my
bags and valises, and myself into the bargain.
I need not tell you that I paid myself heartily
and that, while I was kissing that loveable
hand I kissed it thoroughly. It was an
enchanting hand, with graceful nails and
with a soft, fascinating skin. And, my
word, what a soap she used, a bewitchingly
scented soap.</p>

<p>Footnote by the gentle reader: P. C., go
on with your story!</p>

<p>Well, I will. Yet it is not my, but Miss
Mitzi's story!</p>

<p>By the way, Mitzi is a Viennese diminutive
of Marie, and I ought to translate it by
Pussy, for it is used equally for cats and
girls, which proves that the Viennese have
some trifling knowledge of psychology.</p>

<p>I began by telling her that there had
been no danger of her father asking me
questions about the Salzburg trip. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
could he have guessed that we had travelled
together from Salzburg to Vienna?</p>

<p>Her answer was that she never had
feared such a thing. It was of me that she
was afraid.</p>

<p>"For the present I am locked up, as you
have noticed; but sooner or later I will be
released. My father will then present us to
each other, and I did not want you to exclaim
at that moment: 'Oh! but we have met
already.'"</p>

<p>"Be assured that I will not make the
slightest blunder."</p>

<p>"Now," she went on, "I suppose that
you wish to have an explanation."</p>

<p>"I cannot deny that I feel curious. But
I will not be inquisitive...."</p>

<p>"And I will be candid. It is not in
order to satisfy your curiosity that I am
prepared to give you an explanation, but
because I hope that you will help me. You
are probably the only person who can."</p>

<p>I trust that my dear readers do not place
so much confidence in Patrick Cooper as did
Miss Doblana. I don't want to mislead
anybody by insinuating that her belief in my
capacities was in any way justified. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
must state one thing: My heart leaped up.
Not only were we to share a secret, but I
was to be allowed to help her! I accordingly
promised what you may expect: discretion
and help.</p>

<p>"I must begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>(Holy Sergeant Young, you will be
pleased with this young lady who shares
your principles.)</p>

<p>"I am taking singing lessons. People
say I have a nice voice. It is not a strong
one, but it is expressive. My aim is to
become an operatic singer, though my father
strongly objects. This is strange, as mother
herself was a singer. Yet, strange as it may
seem, there is a reason for it. When mother
married she did not tell him that she was a
sister of no lesser person than La Carina.
Of course, you know La Carina?"</p>

<p>I did not, and I thought best to plead
guilty.</p>

<p>"You do not know La Carina?"
exclaimed Mitzi. "But then&mdash;then&mdash;then I
must begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>(Holy Sergeant Young, etc., etc., as
before.)</p>

<p>"La Carina was a celebrated dancer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
exceedingly beautiful and clever, and famous
for her charming, tiny feet as well as for...."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked I, trying by my question
to help her.</p>

<p>Miss Mitzi blushed and finished her
sentence in a whisper:</p>

<p>"... As for her lover. It seems hardly
believable that you never should have heard
of her adventures with the Archduke
Alphons Hector."</p>

<p>Now, distinguished reader, you&mdash;being
endowed with a better brain than I&mdash;will, no
doubt, remember that name Alphons Hector.
And you will say: Alphons Hector, that is
how the <i>Herr Graf</i> on the evening of <i>Macbeth</i>
was called by Bischoff, the actor.</p>

<p>Readers are supposed to have good
memories. I apparently have a bad one.
When I heard Miss Mitzi pronouncing these
two names "Alphons Hector" they did not
bring any recollection to my brain.</p>

<p>"How my aunt Kathi&mdash;that was La
Carina's real name&mdash;eloped with the Archduke,
how he wanted to marry her, how the
Emperor frustrated that plan, is a story
which has been told so often that I am really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
surprised that you should not know it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was not allowed...."</p>

<p>"But was it not in the English papers?"</p>

<p>"English papers never meddle with
things matrimonial, except when they reach
the Divorce Court."</p>

<p>Miss Mitzi laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "this affair did not
reach the Divorce Court, but it was scandalous
enough. Still, my father would never
have guessed our connexion with royalty,
had not my mother when I was nine decided
to send me to a certain high-class school,
which could not be entered without protection.
So mother wrote to aunt Kathi,
whose daughter was being educated at that
particular school."</p>

<p>I must have made a surprised face at the
mention of the dancer's daughter, for Miss
Mitzi added:</p>

<p>"Yes! the Archduke and aunt Kathi
had two children, a boy and a girl, both
older than I, the boy three years and the girl
ten months. They were called <i>Franz von
Heidenbrunn</i> and <i>Augusta von Heidenbrunn</i>.
Their mother was <i>Frau von Heidenbrunn</i>,
and their father was supposed to be a <i>Graf
von Heidenbrunn</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went to that school and made friends
with Augusta. We soon became inseparable;
nor did my father then object to our
frequenting each other. By and by both
families became acquainted, and father felt
greatly pleased that an Archduke, although
only under the incognito mask of a Count,
should climb up into his modest apartment
of the Karlsgasse. They&mdash;the Archduke
and my father&mdash;became even friendly enough
to collaborate in a ballet&mdash;it was called <i>Fata
Morgana</i>&mdash;and I suspect that my aunt Kathi
had a finger in the pie. However, what was
bound to happen occurred when that ballet
was performed. Up to that time my father
had remained unaware of the relationship
that existed between the two sisters. But
on that particular evening somebody congratulated
my father on having so influential
a brother-in-law ... and, of course, the fat was
in the fire.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to imagine my father's
anger. That he should have been cheated,
he, by his wife, in his own home! He forbade
his door to my poor aunt and to her
children, and if he did not act in the same
way with the Archduke it was only because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he had not the courage to do so. Yet the
result was the same: the Archduke, too,
ceased to visit us. And all our nice intercourse
was over, save for Augusta and me,
who remained friendly and became probably
even friendlier than we had been before.</p>

<p>"Three years ago aunt Kathi died, and
her children left Vienna for Salzburg...."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I.</p>

<p>I leave to you to interpret this "Ah!"
as it pleases you. Was it expressing my
pleasure of finding my way through her
story, or my sorrow at the discovery of who
and what the pretty officer in Salzburg was?</p>

<p>"A little over a year ago," went on Miss
Mitzi, "my mother followed her sister. On
her death-bed she asked father to reconcile
himself with the Archduke and his children.
But he did not yield to her prayer, although
I believe that he loved her dearly. The
Archduke on his side made a step towards
peace and proposed to father another collaboration.
They are writing another ballet
together, which they call <i>Griseldis</i>. Still,
my father persists in not allowing me to see
Augusta. He says that as a daughter of an
Archduke she is too high-born for me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
as a daughter of La Carina too low."</p>

<p>"I see," I exclaimed, "I see what you
were doing in Salzburg."</p>

<p>She looked at me wistfully, as if to say
that a mere man would always be short-sighted.</p>

<p>"Not only was I separated from my
dearest friend, but I was not allowed to frequent
anybody belonging to the theatrical
world. And if I am taking singing lessons
it is on the understanding that I will never
become a professional singer."</p>

<p>"How cruel!"</p>

<p>"Yes, cruel," repeated the dear girl, and
the brims of her eyelids became very pink as
though she were going to have a cry. If I
had dared I would have taken her into my
arms and would have told her ... I knew not
what. One has to be rather experienced to
know what to tell to a sweet creature who
opens her heart, her sorrowful heart to
you.</p>

<p>"Now," she went on, "among the people
who think that I have some talent and could
make a successful operatic singer, there is
a theatrical agent, Mr. Maurus Giulay."</p>

<p>"I know him," I cried, "a fat Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with diamonds on his fingers and...."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Miss Mitzi eagerly,
"is he not a charming man? So full of wit,
and so kind, and such a business man!"</p>

<p>The reader will do well to compare this
appreciation of Mr. Giulay by Miss Doblana
with my own, as reported in chapter three,
and to judge whether I was right in having
taken an immediate dislike to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giulay," continued Miss Mitzi,
and I am sure that her eyes shone while she
was speaking, "Mr. Giulay says I have a
great talent not only as a singer but also as
an actress."</p>

<p>And she added in a low voice, as though
she were telling me a secret:</p>

<p>"He has seen me act."</p>

<p>She remained for one moment as in a
dream, and then went on:</p>

<p>"Of course I am not supposed to know
him at all. Now, on that Sunday morning
when you saw me first, father was playing a
concerto at Prague. The rehearsals were
on the evenings of the Friday and Saturday
before. So on the Friday morning he left
for Prague. I accompanied him to the
railway station to show him off. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
know that he was leaving me alone in charge
of the house; for Fanny had begged of me
to let her go and see her dying mother. Each
time she wants to see her young man her
mother becomes gravely ill; and although I
am well aware that her mother died a good
many years ago I let Fanny depart, because
otherwise she becomes intolerable. I was
therefore quite alone, and, you may believe
me, I did not enjoy it. A little singing, a
little cooking, a little reading, and a good lot
of being wearied, that was how nearly the
whole day passed. But late in the afternoon
something happened. A wire came. A
wire for me. It came from Salzburg and
ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Splendid opportunity for you, meet
me to-morrow evening six at Salzburg
station. Giulay.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"I had no money. It is one of father's
peculiarities to leave me with as little money
as possible. What do you think I did? I
went out and pawned my ring. A nice ring
my mother had given me. I am ashamed to
tell you how little they gave me for it. It
was not even enough for a return ticket; but
never mind, Augusta would lend me my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
return fare. I was not going to Salzburg
without seeing her."</p>

<p>"I passed the night in an undescribable
state of excitement, and on the Saturday
morning I went to the Western Station, took
my ticket and departed. Now, imagine my
feelings when on my arrival at Salzburg
there was no Giulay!"</p>

<p>She made a pause. Probably she
expected me to express my surprise; but I
did not. I kept silent. If I had said anything
it would have been to tell her that I
was not astonished. I knew that I did not
like him. But how to signify such an
opinion to a girl who had just told me that
she found him charming?</p>

<p>"I waited an hour, I waited two hours,
and no Giulay came. So I went to my
friends, where I passed the night, and the
next day I returned home half angry and
puzzled, and half amused at my childish
eagerness. Surely Giulay would give me an
explanation. Yet this explanation I never
received for the same reason that prevented
me from seeing you: I am locked up."</p>

<p>"But why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That, my friend," (how sweet of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to call me friend!) "I don't know, and I
want you to find out."</p>

<p>"But your father must have given you
a reason."</p>

<p>"He has not."</p>

<p>"He is probably angry for your having
gone to Salzburg."</p>

<p>"He does not know it."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"When I came home, just in time,
Fanny had arrived and was, of course, in
great anxiety about me. I told her all, and
I am sure that she has not betrayed me. A
quarter of an hour later my father arrived.
He had had a splendid success and seemed
very happy. He kissed me and was
absolutely as usual. We had some supper
and I went to bed. Tired as I was I fell
asleep at once. But after an hour or so
father came into my room, pale and with
distorted features.</p>

<p>"Mitzi," he called with a voice which I
scarcely recognized. "Who called upon you
during my absence?"</p>

<p>"I told him that nobody did. But he
made a fearful scene, insisting that he knew
all, while he evidently knew nothing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that I would be confined to my room until I
had told him the truth. And since that day
I am here, and every morning he comes and
asks me:</p>

<p>"'Will you confess?'</p>

<p>"And I really do not know what has
happened, nor what he wants from me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"P. C.," calls Guncotton. (I wonder
whether that has any meaning in Chemistry.)
"Here's a letter from Sergeant Young for
you."</p>

<p class="b1">This is what Charlie writes:</p>

<p class="pbq">"My nose is broken, but I don't care.

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">V.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">I have already had an opportunity of
telling you that I had been brought
up chiefly on detective stories. I
therefore thought that there would
be but little difficulty in solving the
case of Miss Doblana. In a nutshell
this case was as follows: She was
sure that nobody had called, while her
father seemed certain to the contrary. How
did he know it? He did not say. The
mysterious visitor had left no card, otherwise
either Mitzi or Fanny would have found
it when they arrived, which was some time
before Mr. Doblana's return. Besides, a
card generally bears a name, and the horn-player's
question to his daughter had been:
"Who called upon you during my absence?"
which proved that he only knew, or thought
he knew, that somebody had called, but did
not know who the somebody was.</p>

<p>We rang for Fanny. Had Mr. Doblana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
asked her anything in connexion with the
affair?</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "on the Monday
morning he asked me who had called during
his absence, and I said: 'Nobody.'"</p>

<p>Thereupon Miss Doblana wanted to
know, why Fanny had not said the truth,
namely, that she did not know.</p>

<p>"He was very cross," answered the girl,
"and I thought that perhaps somebody did
call, and that <i>Fr√§ulein</i> did not wish Mr.
Doblana to know."</p>

<p>"You have a good opinion of me, Fanny.
However, what did he do when you said
that nobody had called?"</p>

<p>"He did not do anything. He swore.
He said that I was in the plot, and that we
were both deceiving him."</p>

<p>"In the circumstances you could have
told him that you were absent all the time."</p>

<p>"And what would have been the good of
it? He would have thought that <i>Fr√§ulein</i>
had removed me intentionally."</p>

<p>I recognized that Fanny had quite a lot
of common sense. So did Mitzi, for an
extraordinary thing took place: She asked
Fanny for advice.&mdash;Think of a young English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
lady asking for the advice of a general, or
even of a between-maid.</p>

<p>Fanny declared that above all <i>Fr√§ulein</i>
must recover her freedom.</p>

<p>"But how?" cried Mitzi and I <i>unisono</i>.</p>

<p>Fanny looked at us and seemed to pity
us for the evident helplessness of our brains.</p>

<p>"The young gentleman" (that was I),
"will go in an hour's time to the opera. The
rehearsal will be over, he will by chance meet
Mr. Doblana leaving the theatre, and they
will walk home together. In the meantime
<i>Fr√§ulein</i> will have dressed and will go out,
and she will, by chance, too, meet the two
gentlemen in the street."</p>

<p>"But," interfered Mitzi, "he will
make a fearful row!"</p>

<p>"In the street?" said Fanny. "No
fear. An Imperial and Royal Member of the
Court Chapel will make no row in the street.
He will present you to each other, and the
young gentleman" (that was, of course,
again I), "will enquire into <i>Fr√§ulein's</i> health,
and <i>Fr√§ulein</i> will answer that she is now
quite well, and she will never more be locked
up."</p>

<p>What a shame that such brains are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
wasted on servant girls! And the Editor of
the <i>Evening News</i> when he reads this
page will say: What luck that a certain
Government did not know that Fanny! A
special department would have been created
for her: she would be appointed President
of the Board of Intelligence.</p>

<p>Up to this day I wonder how she knew
all about Mitzi's journey to Salzburg and
about the Giulay wire. Her young mistress
when talking to her had given her no details,
yet she knew. She knew and even thought
it desirable that <i>Fr√§ulein</i> should communicate
with Mr. Giulay, call upon him and ask
him about that telegram.</p>

<p>"I know," she added, "that it is a
month since he last left Vienna, even for
half-a-day."</p>

<p>"How did you learn this?" asked Mitzi.</p>

<p>"But," said Fanny with just a flavour
of contempt, "I wanted to know. So I made
friends with his mother's cook."</p>

<p>I was overwhelmed. Fanny was revealing
herself as a really superior being. You
may therefore believe me that it was almost
with reverence that I received her instructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"The young gentleman," she said, "will
do well in getting on familiar terms with Mr.
Doblana, for we must know what prevents
him from being more explicit. If the young
gentleman could win his confidence, we might
learn what happened in that hour between
his return home and his declaration to
<i>Fr√§ulein</i> that somebody must have visited
her. Something must have led him to that
wrong conclusion. And the young gentleman
could find out not only what it was, but
also why Mr. Doblana is so vague."</p>

<p>"And how am I to win his confidence?"</p>

<p>Fanny scratched herself. For the first
time she appeared a little perplexed. But
the scratching soon helped.</p>

<p>"I know a way," she declared, "but it
will be terrible. The young gentleman must
learn to play the horn."</p>

<p>Statesmen are merciless.</p>

<p>Now, if you are a reader of the <i>Evening
News</i> you know that Statesmen have often
ideas of a dazzling appearance, but which,
all things considered, prove rather unsubstantial.
They work all right, yet the
results are slight. They seem very clever
ideas, but somehow they do not reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
main point of the question. I am sorry to
state that Fanny in this respect as in other
ways was worthy of her fellow statesmen and
that, brilliant as was the appearance of her
bits of advice, and workable as they were,
they led to no definite result. And so the
reader need not fear that the solution of the
case of Miss Doblana will be reached before
the last chapters.</p>

<p>Yet, the outer reconciliation between the
horny father and his daughter took place that
same day in exactly the same form as Fanny
had foreseen it, and Mitzi recovered her
liberty. Henceforth she had again the freedom
of her movements, and I the pleasure of
seeing her unconstrainedly. But that did
not bring her one step nearer to the knowledge
of what her father was reproaching her
with. His was an obstinate silence. She
asked him why he suspected her of having
received any visitor during his absence, and
he answered sternly:</p>

<p>"You know, and you had better tell me
who it was."</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p>The next day she went to see Giulay;
but she came home greatly disappointed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
swore on his oath that he had not sent the
Salzburg telegram, that he had not left
Vienna, and that there had been no splendid
opportunity whatever which could have
induced him to send that wire.</p>

<p>"Either Giulay lies," explained I to
Mitzi, when she had finished telling me this
story, "or this wire is the keystone of the
whole mystery."</p>

<p>"I am sure," was her answer, "that
Giulay not only speaks the truth, but also
that he is incapable of telling any lies."</p>

<p>Holy Moses! An agent, especially a
theatrical one, was here considered trustworthy.
Well, perhaps my doubt was
unjust&mdash;perhaps we had only arrived at that
chapter which is commonly entitled: "The
Mystery thickens," and without which no
detective story would sell.</p>

<p>"If Giulay speaks the truth," I went on,
"then it is obvious that somebody else sent
that wire, somebody who was well acquainted
with the fact that this particular wire would
make you undertake the journey to Salzburg.
Who can this person be? What can his aim
have been? Why especially to Salzburg?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that it was my
cousin Augusta who sent it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"The suggestion is yours."</p>

<p>"It is impossible. Firstly, had she had
something particular to tell me, I would have
come quite as well if she had called me
signing the wire by her own name instead of
by Giulay's. And secondly, even in case of
her fearing that my father would have
objected to my journey to her, and if she had
wanted to hide from him the reason of my
travelling to Salzburg, she would have been
at the station to meet me on my arrival,
instead of letting me wait there for a couple
of hours, and would have informed me of the
truth. But she was genuinely surprised
when she saw me, and, pleased as she was to
pass a few hours with me, there was not the
slightest reason why she should have called
me to Salzburg."</p>

<p>I did not dare to tell her that to judge
from Mr. Doblana's behaviour something
serious must have happened, and that in my
opinion Augusta von Heidenbrunn was not
free from suspicion. People sometimes think
very badly of their friends, yet they do not
allow others to express these thoughts. So
I kept silent on the point.</p>

<p>Sagacious Fanny was again consulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Fr√§ulein</i> ought to write to the <i>Herr</i>
Lieutenant" (that was Franz von Heidenbrunn's
rank). "Men can do more than
women in such cases. And ask him to find
out who sent that wire. Then we shall know
all."</p>

<p>Once more the advice seemed good, and
Mitzi followed it. The Lieutenant's answer
came by return; he would try, and he felt
pretty sure that he would succeed. After a
week or so, however, there came another
letter saying that he had failed. He had
found the telegraph office from which the
telegram had been dispatched, but the name
of the sender was unknown, and the official
to whom it had been handed was unable even
to remember whether the sender had been a
man or a woman. So we were no wiser than
before.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had followed Fanny's
third suggestion, namely, to make friends
with my host by taking lessons.</p>

<p>M'yes!</p>

<p>What the people who lived underneath
and above us must have thought of my first
trials on the horn I do not know, nor have I
any wish to know it. I dare say my trials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
were a trial to them.</p>

<p>There is a little tune which every
Englishman knows, for it serves to call dogs
with, when they are on tour in the streets.
That tune is the theme which young Siegfried
carols rejoicing in the forest; at least, he is
supposed to do it; in reality it is the first
horn-player placed in the wings of the
theatre. The horn there illustrates rapturous
vital power. You ought to have heard
me and my vital power&mdash;or no! no! You
are a kind person, you have bought this book,
or at least, you have borrowed it from your
Circulating Library, anyhow, you are
reading it; you are a friend, and there is no
reason for my wishing you evil, not even
retrospectively. Nobody can in the least
imagine what I achieved on the horn. At
first I could not utter a sound at all, but
then, when I succeeded!... How the dogs of
Belsize Park would have been jealous had
they heard my barking. And I carolled, not
as if I had been young Siegfried, but a young
dragon, nay! an old one!</p>

<p>That second-hand genius of modern German
music (second-hand down to his very
name, for the first owner of it was the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Johann Strauss), well, Richard Strauss once
said that if he had been Bizet (which, Heaven
be thanked he was not), one would have
heard in the last act of <i>Carmen</i> the bellowing
of the bull counterpointed against the celebrated
duo between Carmen and Don Jos√©.
I do not know whether he ever wrote that
part for the bull&mdash;but with my real talent I
was able after three lessons to play it. I am
sorry that Richard did not hear me, it was
delightfully terrible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="b1">There are strange coincidences. As I
sit there, sucking my pencil (my Turkish
fountain pen having disappeared) and
remembering my first attempts at playing
the horn and, later, at writing for it, something
strikes my ear. A father (at least a
decent one) always recognizes his children,
and if I was no great composer, I may at
least say that I was a decent one. What I
hear is music, played by a military band.
And what do they play? What, if it is not
my own paraphrase on the "Pibroch o'
Donuil Dhu"? Yes, there is a military band
somewhere in the rear, and what the horns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
attack is the theme of "Pibroch o' Donuil
Dhu" set as Doblana had told me to do it.</p>

<p class="pbq">You ask me, ignorant reader, what that
"Pibroch o' Donuil Dhu" is. The oldest
military march ever composed in these foggy
islands of Great Britain, at a time when&mdash;at
a time&mdash;well, earlier than that. It is a
Scotch tune, fierce and proud, the right thing
to be thought of in our fierce and proud time.
I scored an arrangement of it as an entr'acte
when I was writing my opera <i>Lady Macbeth</i>.
But I must not anticipate. How I came to
write <i>Lady Macbeth</i> (not <i>Macbeth</i>, as you
will notice, but <i>Lady Macbeth</i>) that I will tell
in due time.</p>

<p class="pbq">For the present I listen and remember.
That Scotch march, that weird melody, calls
back to my memory all the days of Vienna,
all the story which I am busy writing.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">And while they play, I hum the words
Sir Walter Scott wrote of the old tune:</p>

<p class="ppn10">Pibroch o' Donuil Dhu,<br />
Pibroch o' Donuil,<br />
Wake thy wild voice anew,<br />

<p class="p1">I wonder. How does it happen that they
are playing my march here? I do not even
remember whether I left the score in Vienna
or took it with me.</p>

<p>Now they play other music, the overture
of <i>Poet and Peasant</i>, of course, and the waltz
from the <i>Merry Widow</i> and other things&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Viennese, my God!&mdash;as if to make it still
harder to me, to think that these days of
Vienna, these beautiful days of mirth and
sorrow, should be gone for ever, for ever!&mdash;And
then, then they play the "Pibroch o'
Donuil Dhu" once more, and then nothing
else. Nothing. I dream, I wonder, and
an hour passes.</p>

<p class="p2">"Post!"</p>

<p>This cry would awaken a dormouse.
There are but three things at the front. Long
stretches of boredom, short ones of fright,
and post.</p>

<p class="b1">Two of the letters are for me, and the
first one is from Dad. Just now I had been
wondering at that strange performance of
the "Pibroch o' Donuil Dhu." Here is the
solution of the riddle.</p>

<p class="pbq">"My lad,</p>

<p>"I quite understand that composing
is an impossibility when one is in the firing
line, and I regret having worried you. I
therefore do not send you the music paper.
But I have forwarded a few days ago the
parts of your Scottish march to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
regimental bandmaster. You see, I want
one of your marches to be played when
you are going on towards victory. And
as you can't compose another one, it may
as well be the "Pibroch." Before I sent
the parts I had the music played to me.
It was only a band of the Salvation Army,
I could not get hold of anything else. We
went there to hear it, your mother and I
and Bean, who was just staying in London.
My word, it was beautiful, and it reminded
me of the olden days. If only I could
once more hear the whole opera. Mother
looked very proud and dignified, Bean
wept, but wept like a fountain, and I ...
well, I had it performed three times. I
gave the bandmaster a cheque for ten
guineas. At first he did not want to
accept it; he said it had been a pleasure
to play such beautiful music, and apologized
for the two little mistakes that had
been made..."</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">(Happy man! He had heard only two!)</p>

<p class="pbq">"... And then he pocketed the cheque
all the same. Mother sends you hearty
kisses. So do I.</p>

<p class="pn50">"<span class="smcap">Daniel Cooper.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Dad! Good Dad! There isn't a Dad like
you in all the world.</p>

<p class="b1">The other letter is from Bean. It is
quite short.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Dear Pat" (it runs), "I have just
heard your beautiful music. I am quite
overcome. With such sounds striking our
soldiers' ears, how can they march to anything
else than Victory? I feel that I
must do something, too. My heart drives
me forth.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The girl you left behind you,</p>

<p class="pn60 reduct">"<span class="smcap">Bean</span>."</p>

<p class="p1">And Bean, there isn't a Bean like you
in all the world, either.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have lost a whole day, remembering
and musing. This would have been rather
bad if this book were written to an order
from a publisher. For one reason or
another publishers are always in a hurry.
But then they belong to the higher orders
of animals. A simple <i>Tommyius subterraneus</i>
has plenty of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet perhaps you have not. Therefore I
hasten to return to the nice sounds I used to
extract out of an unhappy horn. It is
intentionally that I used the word "extract,"
which will remind you of a toothache. So
did my blowing the horn. It was pitiful,
yet heroic. For, in truth, I had no wish to
make a living out of these horny studies. It
was all for the sake of the charming Mitzi.
Had I but been in possession of her fleshy
lips!</p>

<p>I notice that this last sentence has a
double sense. On the one hand it means
that I have thin lips and therefore enjoyed
great difficulties in producing any sounds on
the horn. But on the other hand that sentence
also informs you of my ardent desire
to call Mitzi' s red lips my own. I had
fallen in love with her from the first day,
from the very moment when in the railway
carriage I had been attracted by the handsome
contours of ... of ... of the reverse of the
medal. I had now arrived at that state
when the very name Mitzi would strike my
brain with a glowing emotion, when I liked
to forget all other things and to occupy
myself solely with her, remembering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
evenness of the outline of her figure, her
feminine daintiness, her slim, narrow feet.
Yet, I had no experience of women, my
feelings were intense, but my thoughts were
vague, my love was a formless abstraction,
and Mitzi a perceptible fact. In truth, I
did not know that I was in love, and some
time had to pass before I realized it.</p>

<p>In the meantime I used my breath in
blowing the horn. Nevertheless I did not
gain Mr. Doblana's confidence. His intercourse
with his daughter seemed to be
restricted to the utmost necessary, and I
was unable to find out with what offence he
was reproaching her. Still, if I did not
learn his secret&mdash;for it was evidently a
secret&mdash;I had occasion to study his character.</p>

<p>After about a dozen lessons he allowed
that I was hopeless as a horn-player. He
strongly advised me to give it up. But having
once tasted my money (or, to render unto
C√¶sar the things that were C√¶sar's, the
money of Daniel Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd., Insurance
Brokers, London, E.C.), and having
found it savoury and palatable, he decided on
having another helping of it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooper," he said&mdash;he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pronounced my name with a hyphen between
the two o's, associating it probably by some
mysterious etymology with the origin of Cooperative
societies&mdash;"Mr. Cooper, you have
talent only as a composer; but I am afraid
that you will profit very little by the lessons
you take with Hammer. He is a genius and,
poor devil, I do not grudge him the little
money you will let him earn; however, I
venture to say that you would benefit more
by studying with a more practical man like
me. Of course, it could not be the same
figure..."</p>

<p>Now, as he did not know what I was
paying Hammer, these last words could only
refer to his own lessons, the famous attempts
at teaching me the horn, and this was already
twice the cost of Hammer's lessons. But it
was true that I improved little with the
organist's loose and obscure explanations
which, indeed, were more fascinating than
serviceable; and I was only too glad to be
relieved from the torture I inflicted upon
myself and the neighbourhood. Besides,
had I not the duty, as it were, of cultivating
my friendship with Mr. Doblana?</p>

<p>So I accepted, and had Viennese lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in the noble art of composition, from a
Czech, at London terms. Nor had I to
regret my decision, for Mr. Doblana proved
a most invaluable teacher. I have already
stated that I owe to him all I know, little
as it may be.</p>

<p>I was not only his pupil, but his apprentice,
which is the best, the surest way of
learning, for it necessitates a continuous
connexion between the master and the
disciple.</p>

<p>Mr. Doblana was now composing a new
ballet called <i>Aladdin</i>, and many pages of this
work were scored out by me from his
sketches.</p>

<p>Now, if the reader will be good enough
to peruse again the fourth chapter of this
book, he will find that Mitzi had informed
me that her father was working on a ballet
called <i>Griseldis</i>, the book of words of
which&mdash;if I may use the euphemism "book
of words"&mdash;had been provided by the
Archduke Alphons Hector, or the <i>Herr Graf</i>,
whichever name you may prefer for this
exalted person. The book of <i>Aladdin</i>, too,
was signed Joseph Dorff, the Archduke's
nom de plume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>As I was training myself not only as a
composer but also as a detective, I thought
that this inconsistency might have its
importance, and I submitted it to the joint
council of Mitzi and Fanny. Mitzi only
abandoned herself to grief. In former days
she would have known all about it, while
now her father treated her with such indifference!
But Fanny declared the incident of
no importance: The first ballet "Fa<i>ther</i>
Morgana" had also had another name at the
beginning.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mitzi, "it was at first
called <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>."</p>

<p>"How is that possible?" asked I.
"The two subjects seem absolutely different&mdash;as
different as <i>Griseldis</i> and <i>Aladdin</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh!" declared Mitzi lightly, "that
does not matter with ballet. The same
music can always serve for the most dissimilar
objects. When father altered
<i>Daphnis and Chloe</i> into <i>Fata Morgana</i> he
said he had only to add some fifths to the bass,
and some strange drums and tambourins in
order to change his music from occidental to
oriental."</p>

<p>This seemed to me very deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
probably true. So the incident was dismissed.
Yet I had never been nearer a clue!
I ought at least to have noticed that Mr.
Doblana was not merely adapting a musical
dress from its occidental fashion to an
oriental one, but that, musically speaking,
he was making up his <i>balletis person√¶</i> in
real old carpets from Baghdad or some other
such place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One evening&mdash;he and I used to pass his
free evenings together&mdash;we went to a tavern
called the "Tobacco Pipe," one of those places
which a London innkeeper would not fail to
denominate "Ye olde...." The whole of the
Round Table used to meet there once a
month in a nice smoky back-room. It was
a large room, which from its dimensions
seemed lower than it really was. It was
panelled in old dark oak, and on the ceiling
heavy black joists were visible. The tables,
which no table-cloth adorned, were made of
old oak, as were the chairs and the rest of
the furniture. Old fashioned oil lamps fixed
on the joists succeeded in giving the whole
locality a kind of pleasant homeliness,
although these oil lamps were lit by electricity.
I was told that this room was several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hundred years old, and that the new modern
house had been built around it. That room
was in great demand by all sorts of societies,
and it was not possible for it to be hired by
one body oftener than for one evening a
month, because decisions in any trade or
profession had to be taken at "The Tobacco
Pipe" if fashion was to be satisfied.</p>

<p>That day the programme of the Round
Table was to find some means of defence
against the growing invasion of amateurs in
the theatrical and especially the musical
profession. All the people I knew were there
and, of course, many more.</p>

<p>Poor Hammer, who was the senior of the
company, made the first speech. He began
all right, talking of art for art's sake, but
soon lost the subject and, before anybody
knew how it had happened, was explaining
the fundamental difference between medi√¶val
and modern counterpoint. By unanimous
consent he was deprived of the power of
going on with his speech, and, greatly
astonished, sat down.</p>

<p>The <i>Herr Graf</i> said, that being himself
a sort of an amateur he was defending their
cause. He quite understood that hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cases should be prevented from producing
their work in public, but such rule could not
be applied to all. Had not Wagner been
called an amateur? The only way out was
the creation of a special tribunal for such
disputes.</p>

<p>An elderly gentleman who stammered
told the assembly that if Wagner had been
suppressed it would not have been a shame.
He was hissed into silence, and Mr. Bischoff
declared that such words were Anti-German,
that to attack Wagnerism was to attack
Germanism, that Wagner's object had been
the freeing of opera from its traditional and
conventional Franco-Italian forms, and his
one law: dramatic fitness.</p>

<p>Thereupon another speaker arose. He
was a medical man by profession, and his
name was Doctor Bernheim. He declared
that the subject of Germanism was quite out
of place, and that the right way of tackling
the question had been indicated by Mr.
Hammer.</p>

<p>Immediately the old man got up, bowed
in an awkward way and offered his snuff box
to the Doctor, who went on: Certainly, there
were two different classes of artists. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was art for art's sake, music which had only
that one aim of being beautiful, and in this
he included art for technique's sake. The
other class was art for the expression of an
idea, in his opinion the higher form of art,
though he admitted that his opinion mattered
very little. Only these two classes of artists
counted at all, and it was the public's, not
the artist's, duty to decide who could be
ranged in the one or the other category, and
who was not to be counted in either of them.
The struggle against amateurs had to be
fought not by the institution of a tribunal,
but by the production of work either so
skilled or so highly inspired that no amateur
could compete.</p>

<p>Doctor Bernheim seemed to have won
the day when Mr. Doblana chose to take part
in the discussion. In his opinion the Doctor
had made a mistake by including art for
technique's sake into art for art's sake.
Technique could be taught, and learning
alone had nothing common with art. He,
Doblana, knew composers for the brain and
composers for the heart; only the latter were
artists by the grace of God, the only ones he
admitted. The public could not decide who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
deserved this qualification. But the one
fact, that a composer was capable of inventing
new melodies, real melodies, would
entitle him to being called an artist.</p>

<p>I did not like Doblana's view of the
question, yet I would have given anything to
spare him the answer.</p>

<p>It was Giulay, of all people, Maurus
Giulay, who stood up and attacked the horn-player.</p>

<p>"Everybody," he said, "knows that Mr.
Doblana is a good business man. In fact,
there is no other musician of such money
grubbing habits in the whole town of Vienna.
He knows that tunes, little tunes, pay.
There is but one excuse for Mr. Doblana's
petty point of view: his nationality. He
is a Czech, and as such devoid from all sorts
of ideals. It is not his fault if he misunderstands
the whole question. It is his
nationality's!"</p>

<p>Doblana had become quite pale.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> know of the question, you
Magyar!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a terrific outburst
of the whole company. Nobody would have
suspected it a minute before. Nearly all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
members of the Round Table turned against
Doblana, who was supported only by two
other Czechs, three or four Italians, and one
German: old Hammer. As for the <i>Herr
Graf</i>, when I looked for him to see how he
was behaving with his partner, I found that
he had disappeared.</p>

<p>One cannot well imagine how fierce the
outburst was. My calm English brain
could not understand at all this wild talk,
these furious shouts. I was shocked, I must
confess, and I felt a little silly. Evidently
there was no more possibility of reaching a
decision this evening. So with much talk
I induced Doblana to leave with me.</p>

<p>As it was not very late, I suggested a
stroll which would appease my agitated host.</p>

<p>The evening was one of those of which
we never see an example in our foggy island,
an exquisite spring evening, rapturous and
passionately wonderful. You know the evil
smell which fills most big towns just at that
time of the year. Vienna is not so. There
is a gust of perfume which gives spring its
true significance.</p>

<p>As we were walking down first the
Boulevard, or Ring, as it is called in Vienna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and then, after having crossed the river, the
wide road which leads to the Prater, I
imagined what happiness would be mine if
a certain fair girl was moving by my side
instead of her surly father. On the bridge
there stood a lovely flower girl, delayed
probably by some little mishap, with a basket
full of red roses and white lilies of the valley.
I would have bought some for Mitzi...
Suppose I now offered a few to the horn-player...!</p>

<p>Was it not perfectly ridiculous to lose
my sunny youth walking side by side with
an old man, still smarting from what he
considered an insult, and smarting all the
more as there was some truth in what had
been said of him?</p>

<p>We were hardly speaking and I could
think freely of the happenings of this evening
which were in a more or less close connexion
with what interested me most.</p>

<p>Yes, it was quite true that Doblana was
a money grubber. And money was the most
important question in all his art ... in all his
life, I ought to say. He might, in this
respect at least, have been an Englishman,
a Londoner, a City man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>And suddenly I was struck by a thought.</p>

<p>Up to now my idea had been that Mr.
Doblana suspected his daughter of some love
affair. Had I myself not felt something like
mistrust?</p>

<p>Yet, why did he not say so? Why, if
really he was so interested in questions of
money, why did he make such a fuss about
a love affair?</p>

<p>So I jumped to the conclusion that there
was in Mr. Doblana's mind no suspicion of
any secret amours. What had upset him
was certainly something that had to do with
his money glutting.</p>

<p>We were now in the Prater. Never
before had this immense park appeared so
beautiful to me. A bench seemed to invite
us with open arms to a short visit. And a
bench being in that funny German language
a female, we accepted. Artists are incorrigible.</p>

<p>As soon as we had sat down Mr. Doblana
began lamenting.</p>

<p>"I am in bad luck," he said, "that
quarrel this evening ought never to have
happened. Somehow I feel that I am surrounded
by enemies. There must be a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
gang of them. I have been lured into this
discussion, and now I have the whole clique
of the Germans against me. You have no
idea, Mr. Cooper, what intrigues exist in the
theatrical world. They are all jealous
because I happen to make a little money out
of my ballets. They undermine my whole
existence. And I have not only a great
many members of the theatrical and musical
world against me, but also most of the Court
circles. The majority of the Court do not
like to see the Archduke Alphons Hector
writing ballet books for me. They think he
abases himself. They do not know that art
never degrades. Of course, he can bear it
easily. But I! All my existence depends
on it."</p>

<p>"Can I not help you?" said I, thinking
that there had at last arisen an occasion of
capturing that confidence which for weeks I
had been striving to win.</p>

<p>He remained silent. I have told you
already that I had little experience of
women. But I must confess that at this
moment I noticed that I had still less
experience of men. I felt sure that, if I had
been with a nice girl&mdash;I wish he had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
nice girl instead of a morose, old man&mdash;I
should have known what to say. Indeed,
there are not many words necessary. But I
could not profit by the moon, nor by that
mild night of May, I could not possibly put
my arm around his waist and press him to
my manly breast....</p>

<p>After a long while I said at last:</p>

<p>"Can you not trust me, Mr. Doblana?"</p>

<p>"Trust you? Trust you?" he replied.
"I cannot even trust my own daughter, who
works with that gang against me! And I
should trust you, a stranger? No, no, Mr.
Cooper."</p>

<p>And laughing bitterly he suggested:</p>

<p>"Come, let us go home."</p>

<p>We got up and went. I had learned
nothing. I was as ignorant as before.
But....</p>

<p>You will see in the course of this story
that you never can confide in females. And
a bench is a female in German. This one
was as treacherous as all of them. It had
made me catch a cold. Or rather ... the cold
had caught me.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4"><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a></h2>

<p class="pn p2">We have had a few days very
hard fighting. It was shocking.
War may be a necessary
occupation, but it is
scarcely a respectable one. A gentleman
ought to be gentle, above all. When I
enlisted I thought there would be much
sport. There is very little. I also thought
that it would be soothing for my sorrow.
But I am still mortified, though you probably
do not believe me when I assert it.
And I have the feeling that after the war
everything will be changed and that there
will be quite another world, yet that it will
not be any better. Still, I am one sheep in
a herd, and I have to do as the other sheep
do, namely, follow the lead of our bellwethers,
although I am sure that sheep are
not born murderers.</p>

<p>And least we ought to have waited for
Sergeant Young's recovery. He cheers us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
up. He believes in it. And he fights for
something: for his commission. We have
felt very lonely without him. Fancy,
feeling lonely in a battle.</p>

<p>So, having a few days' rest and having
been ordered to the rear, a couple of miles
or so from the firing line, we decide,
three of us, Cotton, Pringle, and I, to call
upon Charles Young. Right we were to do
so, for he is as stimulating as a pick-me-up.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he cries, as soon as he sees
us, and his bandage all over the nose gives
him an American accent, "that's nice of
you two to call."</p>

<p>"Two?" asks Cotton astonished, and
tries to count the three of us. "I think we
are more."</p>

<p>"What's the use of thinking?" replies
the Sergeant, "thinking is the drawback of
all learned men. You are two."</p>

<p>"We are three."</p>

<p>"In theory perhaps. But your theory
fights in vain against facts. I'm as sure
that you are two, as I am sure of getting
my commission."</p>

<p>"How is that?" ask the three of us
(for we are three in spite of his denial).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the surgeon who has arranged
my nose, a very clever chap by the way,
promised me to use his influence with the
first general who would be wounded. That
can't last <i>very</i> long, can it?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to undeceive you," points
out Cotton, "but you had better tell me why
we are two and not three. If it's true I will
believe in the coming of your commission."</p>

<p>"Right!" says Charlie. "Patrick
Cooper is one P.C., and Pringle Cotton gives
another P.C., therefore the three of you are
two P.C.'s. It's as clear as a chemical
formula."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," answers
Guncotton seriously.</p>

<p>"Otherwise your brain is not affected?"
inquires Pringle, full of anxiety.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," answers the Sergeant,
and assumes as mysterious an air as his
bandage permits. "I guess," (this in his
most American nasal pronounciation), "that
there is something the matter with my brain.
Tell me, when the other day I tried to be
lighter than air and flew up, only to show
that I was heavier than air and fell on my
nose, how long was I ... Hun-conscious?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Three minutes," says Cotton.</p>

<p>"Four," I correct.</p>

<p>"Five," asserts Pringle.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asks Charlie pensively.
"I should have thought that it was hours
from the vision I had. Vision or dream, as
you may call it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" says Cotton, "that need not
disturb you in the least. The great rapidity
of dream thought has often been proved, for
instance, by an experience of Lord Holland,
who fell asleep when listening to his secretary
reading to him, had a long dream, and
yet awoke in time to hear the end of the very
sentence which had lulled him to sleep and
of which he remembered the beginning."</p>

<p>"To judge from the length of that sentence,"
observes Pringle, "it must have
been a German book the secretary was
reading."</p>

<p>"In my opinion," goes on Cotton, "the
rapidity of dream thought depends on the
kind of food one had last, on the amount of
its several chemical constituents. Suppose
you had some Methyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>.HO...."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" interrupts the disrespectful
Pringle, and turns to the Sergeant. "Tell
us your vision."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well it was thus:</p>

<p>"We were at a certain place, which had
a certain name, which for fear of the Censor
I cannot call by its real denomination, but
which our boys called Mince from the
amount of Germans which for many days
had been chopped there into mince-meat.
And remember, our men had done it this
time without the help of St. George and his
Agincourt Bowmen. There were thousands
of dead Germans lying in front of our lines,
and the enemy sent up still more men and
still more guns; but the men were shattered
by us and the guns battered into scrap iron.</p>

<p>"At last, when evening came, the
thunder calmed down. If we had wanted
we could have broken through, but we had
no orders to advance. I suppose that our
General wanted Mince to become more
worthy still of its title.</p>

<p>"Now, you remember how the Angels
of Mons had knocked over ever so many Germans.
In Germany, a country ruled by
scientific principles, they thought at first
that we had employed an unknown gas of
poisonous nature. But the <i>Evening
News</i>, and in particular Mr. Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Machen, gave the secret away. And then
the Germans knew all about it.</p>

<p>"Well, to come back to that dreadful
day of Mince; night had fallen and I was
dozing, when I saw suddenly two men in a
red uniform, with black tippets and with a
red feather on their red cap. The one had a
crooked moustache and the other a very high
collar.</p>

<p>"'Father,' said the latter, 'this business
does not seem to go exactly as we had calculated.
What are we going to do?'</p>

<p>"'Little Silly,' answered the one with
the crooked moustache, 'I have lost some of
my prestige, but I still know what costume
to put on and on what occasion. If the
English have called to their help the Angels
of Mons, we will answer with a new frightfulness.
You see our costumes. Understand
that we are going to call the Devils
of Mince.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Some</i> frightfulness!!' said little
Silly acquiescently.</p>

<p>"'Hither Beelzebub! Hither! Dear
devil, quick to our aid!' cried the one with
the crooked moustache.</p>

<p>"At once I heard a great voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Here I am, Monseigneur, Allhighest
Superdevil, here I am, Satan!'</p>

<p>"And a little man with sharp eyes and
a big walking stick, but otherwise dressed
like the two others in red and black,
appeared. I need not give you a further
description, as you may read it in
Macaulay's essay on Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>"The one with the crooked moustache
said at once:</p>

<p>"'Great Grandfather, I have called you
to succour us. Come now and aid us.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon Beelzebub-Frederick answered:</p>

<p>"'Sonny, thou art the Superdevil, and
although I was a greater general than thou
ever wilt be, I do not dare to give thee advice,
especially as I have none to give.'</p>

<p>"The Allhighest Superdevil shrugged
his Imperial shoulders and called again:</p>

<p>"'Hither, Mephistopheles! Hither!
Come and grant us good deliverance.'</p>

<p>"And another devil appeared, an insignificant
looking one. But he answered:</p>

<p>"'Monseigneur, as true as my name on
earth was Treitschke, I am good only at
writing about frightfulness; but I am not
a practical devil.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Again the Superdevil called:</p>

<p>"'Hither, Asmodeus! Hither! Sweet
devil, high chevalier, defend us!'</p>

<p>"This time there came a very big one,
bulky and fat, unable to hide all his baldness
under his red feathered cap.</p>

<p>"'Monseigneur,' he said sweetly, 'I
would willingly have concocted a new Ems
telegram for you; but when you ascended
your Satanic throne your first move was to
send me to hell, where I am still dwelling.
Bismarck refuses to help you!'</p>

<p>"The Allhighest Superdevil called
many more&mdash;with no result however.
Nietzsche's excuse was that he had become
mad. Moltke declared that, having been a
silent man during all his earthly life, he did
not want to talk now that he was living in
hell. And thus each of them had an excuse.</p>

<p>"At last little Silly whispered something
in the ear of his Satanic Majesty.</p>

<p>"'This time you are right, my boy,'
replied the one with the crooked moustache,
'receive my Imperial thanks. I will give
you a supplementary Iron Cross of real gold,
if there is any left. May our old God bless
you.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, once more, he cried:</p>

<p>"'Well then, sweet devil, Messire,
Wicked one, Hostile one, Strong one, thou
real Tempter, quick, quick to our aid!'</p>

<p>"Deep bells began to ring, and yet
another devil appeared. He was very small
with a big head and wore a sailor's beard
under his chin. He had no red-feathered
cap on his head like the other devils, but a
soft velvet toque.</p>

<p>"'You have not treated me as I
deserved,' he said solemnly. 'I had made
so much fuss about my works that four-fifths
of the world mistook me for a real
composer. You have made of my sublime
music dramas a means of propaganda, of
Pan-German propaganda. And you have
done worse. You have accepted that rubbish
by Richard Strauss as equal to my own
immortal work. Some call him Richard the
Second, and some Strauss the Second;
Second he may be, but never First. And
you have abandoned my poor family when
you refused to prolong the Copyright of my
works, my poor wife who had been so
heroically unfaithful to her husband for my
sake, my poor son who in spite of my undeniable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
paternity has not the slightest
musical talent. And further, you have
allowed my <i>Parsifal</i> to be played everywhere,
against my wish, and so revealed to
the world its real value. Still, I will help
you and show you at once the strength of my
<i>Parsifal</i> and the real frightfulness, the one,
the only one which will frighten the
English.'</p>

<p>"Four young knights of Hell approached
him carrying a glass jar. It was
not filled with blood as you may believe, not
with the holy blood of the Grail, but with
the purest strawberry jam.</p>

<p>"'Uncover the jam!' said Wagner,
acting the last scene of <i>Parsifal</i> and not
noticing that the glass jar was not covered.
He began to pray; little round rubies seemed
to shine in the jam. And all the devils
cried:</p>

<p>"'Oh marvel! Marvel of the highest
frightfulness!'</p>

<p>"Then, as in <i>Parsifal</i> the white dove,
a black crow this time descended and
remained soaring above Wagner's head, who
exclaimed triumphantly:</p>

<p>"'Hurrah! Hurrah! Monseigneur! All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the strawberry jam of England is changed
into plum jam&mdash;plum jam with stones to
prove what it is!'</p>

<p>"I fainted. Then somebody threw
water on my face, and I woke again."</p>

<p class="p2">"You must have had too much bacon
for breakfast," says Cotton, "to judge from
the rapidity of your dream. The chemical
composition..."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" interrupts Pringle, "but
you will remember, Sergeant, that we were
talking of <i>Parsifal</i> just before the action
began."</p>

<p>And I add:</p>

<p>"Sergeant, I have every respect for you,
but I must say, you have given your Wagner-Devil
one of my favourite ideas to talk on,
and I put it to you that you have stolen it
from me."</p>

<p>"Don't use strong language."</p>

<p>"All right, Sergeant, but that cackle
about Richard II. and Strauss II. is my
intellectual copyright."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I was a tiny boy, the mater used
to tell me the story of a shepherd who came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with his thousand sheep, to a bridge so narrow
that only one sheep at a time could cross
the brook which it spanned. "And now,
little Pat," she would say, "you must wait
until all the thousand sheep have passed,
and in the meantime you may go and play
with your ball."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Reader, you believe yourself
mighty clever because you think: Ha, ha!
That's the trick he has employed, and while
he told us Charlie Young's dream yarn, he
may himself have got rid of his cold. Well,
you are mistaken. It is not a trick, and the
intermezzo of the preceding pages has its
importance. Nor will you be spared to
undergo the story of my cold, and the only
thing I can do for you is to wish you that it
may not prove contagious.</p>

<p>It was a bad cold.</p>

<p>Now, a cold where you merely weep and
sneeze and sniff and blow your nose which
by degrees becomes somewhat like a burning
Zeppelin&mdash;by the way, if you never have seen
a burning Zeppelin, I take this opportunity
to inform you that it is, of course, like the
splendid, brilliant, luminous, glaring nose
of one who has such a cold&mdash;such a cold may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
be <i>called</i> a bad cold, but it <i>is</i> not. It is a
coryza. It is a cold in the head, an unimportant
part of the human body when the
point in question is a cold. With such a
cold you are only more or less ridiculous.</p>

<p>But when you begin coughing and spitting,
and when high fever sets in, when you
think that you would not like to die yet,
especially from pneumonia, and when your
Mr. Doblana recognizes with real regret
that he must interrupt the lessons and will
be unable to charge you for the time lost;
when the doctor must be called, and when
after a fortnight you begin to recover but
still feel weaker than a child, then you have
a bad cold, one of these perfidious colds you
catch in May.</p>

<p>However, if you possess one of those
sunny natures such as I pride myself of
having, if you know how to find roses among
thorns, if you can remember that old Jew
who used to say whenever he could:
"<i>Gamsoo l'towvo</i>," which means: "This too
leads to the best"&mdash;you see, being on the
classical side I was taught Hebrew in the
Special Class and never forgot that sentence&mdash;then,
m'dear, you will only remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that this bad cold was very nice, inasmuch
as it brought you nearer to your beloved
Mitzi. You will ever recollect that sweet
contact which will have made of your nasty
illness a time of continuous joy.</p>

<p>I felt as if I had only begun to live since
I was ill, and I was sure that she also
experienced for the first time a great, primitive
emotion, and that to her nothing else
was worth thinking of. She was taking
care of me and seemed made quite glorious
by this obligation imposed on her. And yet
we did not speak, we were awed, all words
seemed futile.</p>

<p>The medical man who attended to me
was Doctor Bernheim, the same whose
acquaintance I had made at the Tobacco
Pipe. He was a very intelligent fellow, and
we sympathized as much as such a thing is
possible between two individuals of thirty
years' difference of age. He was a man
interested in politics as well as in art, and,
what is more remarkable, he was nevertheless
a good doctor.</p>

<p>One day I told him how thoroughly
incomprehensible the quarrel between
Doblana and the other members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Round Table had seemed to me. This was
the beginning of a series of conversations,
during which Doctor Bernheim first
explained me the complicated question of
Austrian nationalities, the struggle between
the different races.</p>

<p>There was, above all, the continual
strife for superiority between the Western
(Austrian) and the Eastern (Hungarian)
half of the Monarchy. Then there were in
both parts internal contests, for neither was
the population of Austria entirely German,
nor that of Hungary entirely Magyar. In
both halves of the country a large percentage
of Slavs was to be found, among which the
rising Czech people, both intellectual and
industrial, could not be neglected. Of late
years German influence had become observable,
and there was now in Austria a distinct
Pan-Germanic tendency. A tacit understanding
existed between the German and
Hungarian population, whose purpose was
the suppression of all Czech aspirations.</p>

<p>Then there was a Polish question, the
Galician Poles demanding to be united with
the Russian and German Poles into one
Kingdom,&mdash;an Italian question, Trieste and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Gorizia as well as the Trentino wishing to
be incorporated into Italy,&mdash;a Rumanian, a
Ruthenian, a Serbian question.</p>

<p>Nor was that all. A violent Anti-Semitic
movement had been originated by
the clerical party, which was jealous of the
ever brisk business capacity of the numerous
Jews&mdash;of which the Doctor himself was one.</p>

<p>In one word, there was everywhere contrariety
and quarrelling, dissension and
discord.</p>

<p>Mitzi, who sometimes was present at
our discussions, was very intransigent. She
had an inborn hatred for all what was
German and Hungarian, although German
was her mother tongue. In her heart she
was a Czech. Of modern music she loved
only Italian, French, and Czech, but she
loathed the modern Germans for their
utter lack of feeling. On this point as on
so many others there was complete agreement
between her and me. I had myself
observed that the unrivalled reputation of
Vienna as <i>the</i> musical city <i>par excellence</i>
was upheld above all by Italian and Slav
musicians. The Germans, although they
made much ado about themselves, played an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
inferior, if a not altogether, secondary part.</p>

<p>I suppose I had a good time. Most
people know the course of events, when by
degrees an agreement of affections is changed
into ... tenderness. So I dare say you can
do without my description.</p>

<p>But one day something happened. It
was quite an insignificant incident, yet it is
one which I cannot forget. Simply it was
that Mitzi sang to me. It was the fourth or
fifth day since I had been allowed to leave
my bed. I had never heard her except for
a few exercises.</p>

<p>Her voice is not a very strong one, but
there was never one as warm nor as expressive.
It went at once into my heart, as
Mitzi herself that day went into my life.
What she sang mattered little, short folksongs,
I believe, quite simple, yet her voice
has that incomparable faculty of changing
all what she sings into purest gold, as Midas
did to all he touched.</p>

<p>Yes, it was rather an insignificant, little
incident. Nor was there any revolution in
me. No, but an evolution began. Slowly,
vaguely, feelings came to me. Feelings, not
thoughts. They were all inside my breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and&mdash;my word&mdash;they did hurt. Mitzi had
with her singing struck a chord of gold,
which was vibrating in my heart.</p>

<p>"<i>Fr√§ulein</i> Mitzi," said I, for I had not
yet learned to call her by her name alone;
"if you will help me a little, and encourage
me, I will write an opera for you. There is
something exceedingly tender and impressive
in your voice, something childlike.... I
am sure you will inspire me, you will be my
Muse."</p>

<p>Possibly you imagine that she was
flattered, or at least pleased. Nothing of
the sort, my dear. She just looked doubtful.
She ought to have begun at once with
the encouragement business I had suggested.
A little phrase as, for instance, "That would
be nice!" would not have cost her much.
Any English girl would have said it. True,
it would not have meant much, either, and
she wasn't an English girl. Yet&mdash;I owe you
some frankness, don't I?&mdash;I was somewhat
disappointed. If I am not greatly mistaken,
she turned up her nose a little when she
said:</p>

<p>"Are you sure you will be able to write
an opera?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"For you, <i>Fr√§ulein</i> Mitzi, I will be able
to do anything!"</p>

<p>Indeed, such was my feeling. Yes, her
very indifference was encouraging me. Such
is man when he is in love. Her apathy
made me suffer, and my wretchedness only
stimulated me. Sure, I would show her of
what I was capable. Her insensibility only
augmented my emotion.</p>

<p>"I don't like your calling my voice
childish, and if you compose something for
me it will have to be heroic."</p>

<p>"I never said that you had a childish
voice."</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"I did not. I said 'childlike.'"</p>

<p>"There is no great difference."</p>

<p>Thus our quarrelling began. And I may
well say that the same hour which saw the
birth of my love also germinated the origin
of its end.</p>

<p>Ladies have many uses for their tongue.
Amongst other things, they sting with it.
And therefore we love them.</p>

<p>However, important as this may be,
surely it does not interest you, to whom my
philosophy is of no use. So I return to my
story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>I went to Mr. Bischoff as soon as my
health was a little restored. I wanted to
write a music drama on <i>Macbeth</i> as he had
suggested. Should he not be willing to
write a libretto on the basis of those wonderful
ideas he had exposed to me? I was sure
that I would succeed in making with his aid
a real masterpiece.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you consider with what an important
personality I had chosen to deal, you will
not be surprised when hearing that it was
not "on the basis of those wonderful ideas
he had exposed to me" that Mr. Bischoff
agreed to write the said libretto. He wanted
the basis to be more ... substantial. I need
therefore hardly tell you what the next step
was. And, still considering that Mr.
Bischoff was the first Viennese actor, and
had refused offers for mere translations from
a London firm at ten shillings a thousand
words, you will easily imagine which figure
I asked Daniel Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd., to put
on his next cheque. But I tore my letter immediately
into pieces and wrote another, asking
for ¬£50 more, I could as well bleed my poor
dad of ¬£300 as of ¬£250, couldn't I? And the
supplement would enable me to show my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
intense gratitude to my charming nurse, and
even to show it more than once.</p>

<p>I deeply regret to announce that Miss
Doblana exhibited a much greater satisfaction
when I offered her a beautiful fan
of white ostrich feathers than when I had
opened to her the perspective of my opera.
She was really winsome as she thanked me,
oh! so winsome. Yet, to-day, after years,
I think that it was very foolish of me to
make her such a gift. Most men will share
this opinion, although most girls will judge
it otherwise. As for Mitzi, I fear that she
foresaw more gifts and decided there and
then to take my opera into the bargain.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that fan was bought (but not
paid for) and offered to the lady of my heart
before the cheque arrived from London.
And then something very awkward occurred.
Daniel Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd., sent me a cheque
for ¬£300, not payable to me but to Mr.
Bischoff. I am sure this mischievous move
was caused by mother. For while father's
letter was nice and gentle as ever, and while
he stated being sure that with such a
librettist I would achieve something remarkable,
mother wrote that in her idea it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
nonsense to attempt an opera before having
well learned how to write one; and there
was something between the lines that read
as if she was smelling a rat.</p>

<p>Now, what was I going to do with my
cheque for ¬£300? I could not well go to Mr.
Bischoff and ask him for change, for if I
knew little of women and even less of men,
I knew already a lot of the third sex, viz.:
the artists. There was no probability of his
being able to give me change for ¬£50, and,
candidly, I did not trust any artist
sufficiently, especially not Mr. Bischoff
whom I scarcely knew, to let him have the
cheque as it was, and wait for the ¬£50 change
until he had cleared it. I felt like a schoolboy,
comfortless and wretched, and as
usual: silly.</p>

<p>For three days I went about absolutely
miserable with my big cheque in my pocket.
My state of mind could not escape Mr.
Hammer who, finding a few bad mistakes in
a fugue of mine, declared that this and the
rest of my behaviour proved clearly that I
was in love, an accident that had befallen
him in former years every six weeks, so that
he had a sufficient experience to pass judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
on other people. Now, if even
Hammer saw my uneasiness, you will
understand that it was soon noticed by Mr.
Doblana who, although a musician too, was
far more a human being. He inquired. He
insisted. For one of the results of being so
human was a certain degree of curiosity.</p>

<p>"It must have something to do with
your opera," he asserted at last. "How
far have you got with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, "I have not begun yet."</p>

<p>"Then," cried he, "why do you make
such a face as if you had lost your score?"</p>

<p>I am sure that, when I heard this question,
I looked at him in the most idiotic
fashion you may imagine. And I must have
looked at him for a long time, say, twenty
seconds, which is much longer than most
people think. Two ideas had flashed up
through my brain, (or whatever you may
call it).</p>

<p>The second&mdash;which was probably the
result of the excitement caused by the
first one&mdash;the second was to return the ¬£300
cheque to my father, and to ask him for
several smaller cheques which I could hand
Mr. Bischoff in proportion to the work done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a proceeding which certainly would please
the mater, for it proved me to be an earnest
chap.</p>

<p>Yes. And the first idea?</p>

<p>I simply discovered the mystery which
Mr. Doblana was hiding:</p>

<p>He had lost the score of his ballet
<i>Griseldis</i>, which he had been composing
before <i>Aladdin</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">VII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Like most modest, unassuming persons
I am proud of a lot of things.
Thus, without any boasting, I
think I am fairly discreet. You
may therefore imagine how astonished I felt
when I found myself next morning in Mr.
Doblana's studio, carefully rummaging his
drawers in search of the manuscript of his
ballet <i>Griseldis</i>. I had an excuse: I was
doing detective work, and the discreet
detective is a type that has still to be
invented. But you may believe me: I was
unceasingly blushing.</p>

<p>During the night I remembered a conversation
which I had overheard by chance&mdash;please,
<i>do</i> not forget that I am a discreet
person&mdash;a conversation between Mr. Doblana
and the <i>Herr Graf</i>. It had taken place the
first time that I was admitted to the Round
Table, and I have duly reported it in
Chapter III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>(I am absolutely distressed always to be
obliged to refer the reader to previous
chapters. It gives this story, which otherwise
would be quite pleasant, an almost
scientific appearance. But my unbounded
inexperience in the art of writing must be
taken into account.)</p>

<p>This conversation then had mentioned
the loss of one of Mr. Doblana's works. The
name of the work was not stated, nor how
it had been lost. A musical work may be
lost otherwise than by the actual disappearance
or destruction of its manuscript. A
hostile report may mean its definite ruin.
But once the idea had struck me that Mr.
Doblana's strange calamity was indeed the
loss of his manuscript, the recollection
of that colloquy with the <i>Herr Graf</i>
strengthened my opinion. So I tried to
make sure whether <i>Griseldis</i> really had
disappeared.</p>

<p>After I had made an hour's careful
search, and inspected every paper, leaf by
leaf, without finding the slightest trace of
the manuscript, I decided that I was right.
I further concluded that the horn-player was
convinced of its having been stolen, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
with the help of his own daughter.</p>

<p>As it had a considerable monetary value,
he must have been very sore about the disappearance
of his work. The simplest thing
would of course have been to communicate
with the police. But tied to a collaborator
of so high a position as the <i>Herr Graf</i> he
could not well take such a step without consulting
him. Clearly Doblana had not
obtained his support, a prominent member
of the Court having probably no desire for
any business with the police. Thus the
matter was at an end for my poor host. He
had to remain quiet, and despair was his
only consolation.</p>

<p>But I at least was not compelled to have
any consideration, and I wanted badly to
free Mitzi from the suspicion which lay
upon her. From what I knew, it was
absolutely unjust. She had been lured into
a journey, and her absence had been misused.</p>

<p>By whom?</p>

<p>Who was the thief?</p>

<p>An examining magistrate must sometimes
have a very uncomfortable feeling.
For, if one has a preconceived idea in such a
case, it is difficult to free oneself from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
I experienced this. In my mind Giulay was
the main hinge on which the whole business
turned. From the beginning I had conceived
it so, and hard as I tried to get rid
of this idea, it always came back to me:
Giulay had sent the wire, in spite of his
denial, knowing quite well that it would
decide Mitzi to go to Salzburg. And Giulay
did not like Mr. Doblana, as he had shown
by attacking him in a tactless and violent
way, without apparent reason, in the course
of the evening at the Tobacco Pipe.</p>

<p>The great difficulty for me consisted in
the impossibility of talking about the whole
affair to Mitzi. I held the man to be capable
of any villainy. But there was no probability
of getting Mitzi to divest herself of
the prejudice she had in favour of the ugly
Hungarian. If I had expressed but a little
of my thoughts she would at once have
accused me of wronging him, she would have
resented it as an annoyance; and for no
consideration would I wish to annoy her.</p>

<p>So I kept my suppositions to myself.
One point above all seemed to me important.
The thief must have known not only that, on
receipt of the telegram, Mitzi would hurry
off to Salzburg, but also that Fanny was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
absent on a holiday. At one moment I
suspected the plump servant girl of being
Giulay's accomplice. What if her going to
visit her dying mother had only been a feint?
Suppose that she had returned in order to
admit Giulay? However, I soon set aside
this theory; Fanny was altogether devoted
to Mitzi, and no consideration could have
decided her to do such a treacherous thing.</p>

<p>I asked both of them, Mitzi as well as
Fanny, whether anybody had known that the
latter would have a three days' holiday. As
I did not want to tell them why I asked the
question, they did not think as hard as I
should have liked. They could not remember.
And Mitzi who, of course, guessed that
my inquiry was somehow connected with the
great mystery, only wondered why I still
worried over that old, half-forgotten affair.</p>

<p>There is, as a matter of fact, a mistake
into which readers of detective stories are
generally enticed. It is to believe that the
persons involved are doing nothing else but
thinking of their case. They have no business,
no trade nor profession, they have no
friends to call upon, they have no letters to
write, no plays to see, no books to read, they
hardly ever rest, and they wash, dress, eat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and sleep only when it is necessary for the
conduct of the case. This is all untrue; in
reality, it happens quite otherwise. I am
sure I was as interested in my case as any
detective in his, yet I thought of it only
occasionally, and I went on having my
lessons with old Hammer as well as with
Mr. Doblana and thinking of my <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>When the horn-player first heard of my
operatic ambitions, he said that it would be
quite a good exercise, and that writing was
the best way to learn how to do it. The
opera would certainly not be performed, but
that did not matter, as I was not working
for money, being sufficiently well off without
the paltry sums which I might earn in
the form of royalties.</p>

<p>With Hammer it was quite otherwise.
He grew immediately enthusiastic. Enthusiasm
was one of his principal features.
My words, repeated rather parrot-like from
what Bischoff had said to me, namely, that
it would be "a tissue of terror, of trembling,
of anxious forebodings and of dreadful
silence," pleased the old organist specially.
To say the truth, I had no proper idea of
how this tissue was to be produced.</p>

<p>Hammer told me that it always had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
his ambition to write an opera, but that he
never had been able to find a libretto which
he had judged suitable for his particular
talent.</p>

<p>"Bischoff has proposed <i>Macbeth</i> to me
too," he said. "But the objection that I
believed myself unable to express the local
colour was too great. I was afraid of
failing in one of the most important points.
This danger does not exist for a Scotchman
like you."</p>

<p>"But I am no Scotchman."</p>

<p>"Isn't Hampstead in Scotland?" (He
pronounced it Hampshtead with his undeniable
Austrian accent.) "You told me,
it was up North."</p>

<p>"North London&mdash;and you must not tell
that to a Londoner&mdash;they believe it is West."</p>

<p>"I regret it for your sake. Have you
any idea of Scotch folk tunes?"</p>

<p>"I know <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>."</p>

<p>"That is better. But I advise you,
before you begin with the composition of
your great work, to write a few Scotch songs
as an exercise, like Wagner, who wrote a few
songs as studies for his <i>Tristan</i>."</p>

<p class="b1">The advice seemed good to me, and I
composed fifteen Scotch songs as an exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for <i>Macbeth</i> which, according to Mr.
Doblana, was itself but an exercise for
future operas. I chose them among the
many lyrics, which exist in good metrical
German translations, so that I had them
ready in both languages. I wrote my songs
in what seemed to me an incredibly short
time at the rate of a song a day. Modest as
I am, I must nevertheless confess that they
are not bad, considering that I am ... no,
that I was a British composer. British
composers have been told so many times
about their having no talent that they have
come to believe it. But it is not true. We
have quite as much heart and feeling and
imagination as other nations. Only we have
also the fog. Which means that we may be
allowed to be born in our isles, but that we
will do well to go and compose somewhere
else. This is what by chance I had done.
Thus it happened that my fifteen Scotch
songs were quite possible, and one at least
was good. But who would not have been
inspired by Sir Walter's immortal words?</p>

<p class="ppq2">"Breathes there the man, with soul so dead.<br />
Who never to himself hath said</p>
<p class="pp20i">This is my own, my native land!<br />
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,<br />
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd,</p>
<p class="pp20i">From wandering on a foreign strand!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">These songs have never been printed,
yet I am glad to have written them. They
sleep in a drawer in a nice cosy house in
Belsize Park. They sleep, but they are not
dead. They live in my memory and remind
me of the most beautiful day which was yet
given me to live.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Post.</p>

<p>And an exceptionally big mail, containing
three letters and a few papers. The
"Illustrated London News," sent to me by
an old aunt. They are full of war pictures
which she forwards to me so that I may have
an idea how things look in reality, as we in
the trenches have certainly only a very vague
idea of the aspect of the whole business.</p>

<p class="b1">One of the letters is from a lady who
signs Thirza Ellaline de Jones, and is
addressed to my regimental number only.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Dear N¬∫...," it runs, "if, as I suppose,
you are a lonely soldier, I wish to
inform you that I am willing to offer you
my friendship, for I am myself a lonely
maiden. I often think how awful it must
be for you to have nobody to think of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that in your murderous business you are
never relieved by that wonderful thought:
'It is for her that I do all these sanguinary
deeds.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"I am of a romantic, passionate
nature, and I am sure you ought to like
exchanging ideas with me. My character
is rather pessimistic, having thoroughly
read Shopenower (<i>sic!</i>), yet I feel sure I
could cheer you up. Besides, I think
that our acquaintance, started under the
fire of the guns, could after the war lead
to a more pleasant union. I am scarcely
of middle age, but I look much younger
than I am, and I feel younger still. I do
not enclose my photo, for I think that men
who have gone through the serious business
of war are not concerned with trifles.
But I may add this: The war will not
finish before every man is disabled. You
will then be entitled to a pension. If it
pleases you, you may now add to this the
amount of my private income which is of
¬£140 a year.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Answer by return, and you will be
a dear.</p>

<p class="pn50 reduct">"Yours ever,</p>
<p class="pn40 reduct">"<span class="smcap">Thirza Ellaline de Jones</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter is typewritten, and the traces
of wax on the back show that it is reproduced
from a stencil. What a mania!</p>

<p>The second letter is from a firm, Levy
and Levy, who offer the highest prices for
souvenirs, especially for German helmets.</p>

<p class="b1">And the third one is from home.</p>

<p class="pbq">"My dear Patrick," writes the mater,
"we are glad to hear that you are all
right, and hope that you will endeavour
to keep so. I strongly advise you to wear
the same underclothing you are used to,
namely, that of Doctor Lahmann. I
would have sent you some, but I find that
their place in Holborn has disappeared.
They have probably been wound up by our
Government, who do not see the difference
between good and bad things. But I
imagine that among the prisoners you
take, you will find one able to procure from
Germany whatever you want.</p>

<p class="pbq">"I do not know on what mysterious
business Bean is engaged. But she comes
three times a week to town, all the way
from Bedford. She says that what she
does is a holy duty, which I think is rubbish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
I suspect father of being in the
secret and resent his hiding it from
me. Still, I must say that she is as pretty
as ever, even prettier. And also that old
Dicks is making pots of money out of a big
Government contract for tinned vegetables.</p>

<p class="pbq">"I regret your enthusiasm over
father's silly idea to upset you by having
your Scottish march played in the middle
of the battlefield, instead of leaving you
quiet and cosy in your trench. I hope
that you will soon send us good news. I
remain your always loving</p>

<p class="pn60">"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">And dad joins a half sheet:</p>

<p class="pbq">"My darling boy,</p>

<p class="pbq">"Nothing could please me more than
the thought that you have been happy
for a moment, while hearing the 'Pibroch
o' Donuil Dhu.' I am so busy that I have
scarcely the time to write. I will only
add to what your mother says, that a word
to the wise will be sufficient. Bean is the
dearest girl I know and will be quite well
off. And between men I may say this: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know you used to object to her being so
thin. She is growing plump now.</p>

<p class="pbq">"A thousand kisses from your loving</p>

<p class="pn60">"<span class="smcap">Daniel Cooper</span>."</p>

<p class="p1">Bean plump, Bean growing actually
plump! I confess that this opens perspectives
I had not suspected. Still....</p>

<p>You see, she is nine years my junior.
And as I am twenty-nine (rather a ladylike
age, isn't it?) you will be able to calculate
that she is twenty. And I suppose that it is
also twenty years since our respective
respected parents regard us as betrothed.
Yet, it has never been spoken out openly.</p>

<p>Violet Dicks, commonly called Bean, is
indeed pretty. She plays the piano a little,
but with such apathy that I have always
avoided listening to her other musical
achievements, which consist in a little singing
and a little concertina playing. However,
I must say that there is something like
mutual consent in my ignorance of her
musical performances. She is very shy, not
generally, but in matters musical, and would
never dare to sing or to play to a composer,
even to an abdicated one. She plays tennis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
but is no good at bridge. She writes many
unimportant letters, all exceedingly short,
and never reads a book, nor anything else.
She spends all her pocket-money on dragging
her mother to London every time a new
musical play comes on. She says she loathes
them, but she is always hoping that there
will one day be a good one. She is also
interested in petty charities, bazaars, garden
parties, and so on. And as far as it is
possible with her, she is in love with me.</p>

<p>But I do not think that hers is one of
those great, magnificent loves we read of in
books. She is more a vegetable than a
flower; as a flower she is only a violet, as a
vegetable only a bean. A green bean. A
slender, green bean.</p>

<p>Yet I have a certain tender feeling for
her. I should not like her to suffer in the
least. I feel myself quite capable of marrying
her, and even of being a good husband to
her, if it were absolutely necessary. On no
account could I let her die from a broken
heart. But then, I suppose it would not
break.</p>

<p>She is not, like Thirza Ellaline de Jones,
of a romantic, passionate nature, nor does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
she even know that Schopenhauer ever
existed. And if it were essential for a lonely
soldier like me to exchange ideas with a
female, I would rather do it with Bean who
has none, than with Thirza Ellaline who has
less. As for the reason why I do all these
"sanguinary deeds," Thirza Ellaline must
excuse me and mind her own business. There
exists something which I should call the
chastity of patriotic sentiment, and it would
be immodest to divulge it.</p>

<p>No, Thirza Ellaline, oh thou of the unphotographable
face! In spite of thy private
income of ¬£140 (and I add, not because of
Bean's income which is probably twenty
times bigger, a fact that I could overlook if
thou wert a little more photographable and
a little less pessimistic) I say <i>nay</i> to thee.
Nay&mdash;never!</p>

<p>Whereas Bean... It is still: "not yet."
But I confess that the idea of her has been
growing lately somewhat more familiar. I
do not know when, why, nor how that change
began. That she wept when she heard the
"Pibroch o' Donuil Dhu" performed by the
band of the Salvation Army has but little
to do with it. Weeping under such stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
has happened to more hardened people.
Now there comes the news of her growing
plump. But it comes as a mere abstraction,
for I feel unable to imagine a flat pancake
as a round dumpling. No, I don't know
why, but there is now something in the word
Bean&mdash;a meaning&mdash;which was not there
before. It is but slight, yet it is. Still,
can it ever grow as long as there lives the
remembrance of another?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let me tell you how it occurred.</p>

<p>I had finished those Scotch songs and
was rather pleased with them. They were
written to suit Mitzi's voice, and so one
evening I played them to her. The one I
preferred, namely, Scott's "<i>Breathes there
a man</i>," was unfortunately the one which
agreed least with her particular ability. But
you ought to have heard her singing "<i>My
heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not
here</i>." There was such an ardent longing
in her voice, such a desire of seeing again
the mountains covered with snow and the
"wild-hanging woods," and to hear once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
more the "loud-pouring torrents." It was
all so true, so sincere. I made her sing it
again and again. She appreciated Burns'
words. She had only to think of the beautiful
Austrian Alps which she knew so well. But
she understood also my setting of the words.
She sang it as I would have done it, had I
had a voice and mastered the difficulty of
controlling it. She sang it directly out of my
own soul. Never was there such a comprehension,
such a communion of feelings.</p>

<p>She was standing behind me, a little to
my right. Her pleasure in singing my song
was equalled by mine at hearing her. When
she had performed it eight or ten times I
stopped at last. I was overcome with
emotion.</p>

<p>And suddenly I felt her hand caressing
my hair.</p>

<p>I trembled. I perceived something happening;
a breath, so to say, a mere nothing.
Joy and terror at once filled my heart. I
gazed at her, and in the twilight I saw a
tender smile around her lips. It made me
feel out of breath, as if I had been walking
too fast.</p>

<p>I got up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"Let us go out a little," I said, "the
evening is wonderful."</p>

<p>We went. Doblana was at the opera
blowing his hard part in the <i>Mastersingers</i>,
which would keep him till nearly midnight,
and we had two hours and a half before us.
The streets were already empty, for Vienna
is a town that goes to sleep very early,
thanks to a twopenny fine imposed on each
inhabitant who comes home after ten o'clock.
The sky was clear and the moon looked like
a round silver cake from which somebody
had helped himself to a tiny slice of
the crust. No stars were visible, but as we
had gained the boulevard, the electric lamps
growing smaller and smaller in the distance
appeared like starry dust.</p>

<p>We entered the municipal park. It was
quite empty, and the right frame for romantic
amours. For I knew by now into what
our companionship little by little had grown.
My heart was throbbing, hers probably too,
and we felt that the park was an accomplice
of the sentiments which were leading us
along our walk.</p>

<p>There are many cosy corners in that
park. And each one of these corners is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
adorned with a statue. Before that of
Schubert we halted. Why, I do not know,
for it is not remarkable in any way. Yet
we looked at it as if it had been the goal of
our pilgrimage. We were as if transported.
We were silent and gazed at Schubert as if
he were something new and delightful, as if
he were a new invention of the heart,
enrapturing, transporting, fit to throw us
into a sweet ecstasy. And yet he was only
a fat gentleman in white marble, sitting in
a chair and holding a conventional sheet of
music paper in his hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mitzi began to sing softly:</p>

<p>"My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
is not here..." and then the love that for
months had been lying longingly at her door,
and had voicelessly cherished her, the love,
my love, broke forth. I caught her by the
neck and bending my face down to her's I
touched her lips, whispering:</p>

<p>"I love you, Mitzi, I love you."</p>

<p>Her eyes were closed and she kissed me
back. Mine was a marvellous happiness,
for I felt that I was her's, vanquished, beaten
by her charm. My love was not a conquest,
but a capitulation&mdash;and yet I was happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, pity me, compassionate
reader, for ... do you know how long my happiness
was to last? Fate, cruel, inexorable
fate, had allowed me one minute, one single
minute. Then a devilish laughter, coming
from some hidden corner in the shrubs,
awoke me.</p>

<p>Of the old guilds of Vienna one still
exists. It is the Company of the Bootmakers.
Originally established to afford aid
to necessitous members of their trade, the
Company by payment of large sums obtained
various monopolies. In London there are
bootsellers, dealers in boots, which are manufactured
in big factories. In Vienna there
are still bootmakers. Their Company having
from entrance fees, fines, and so on,
acquired some money which was employed
in the purchase of land, became known,
because of the rise in the value of property,
to have amassed enormous wealth. The
bootmakers are still divided into masters,
companions, and apprentices; and so rich is
the guild that to be an apprentice bootmaker
is sometimes more advantageous than to be
a master in another trade. So is the fact
explained that you may see walking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in Vienna "bootmakers' lads" aged thirty
or forty, very proud of their green aprons.</p>

<p>These "lads" provide one of the many
typical figures of Vienna. They are the
naughty boys of that city. There is no
mischief they will leave undone, if they see
a possibility of its performance. There is
no cheeky remark they will leave unsaid.
They are wasps, and every day a new
exploit, or a new <i>bon mot</i> of a bootmakers'
lad is told in Vienna.</p>

<p>It was such a lad who came laughing at
us out of the shrubbery. I could have
thrown myself upon him and given him the
thrashing he deserved. But I stopped when
I saw him in the moonlight.</p>

<p>He was a little man of about twenty-five.
He was lame. He had black hair, a
black moustache, and a pointed tuft of black
beard on his chin, and with his mocking
expression he reminded me of the Frenchman
who at Salzburg had made room for ...
Mitzi, of the conductor who had united me
to ... Mitzi, and of the cabby who had brought
me again to ... Mitzi.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">VIII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">My first idea had been to talk
immediately to Mr. Doblana
and inform him that I intended
marrying his daughter. I told
Mitzi this while we were going home through
narrow, dark streets, as becomes thieves and
lovers. But she objected. She was rather
cool, the result probably of yonder bootmakers'
lad's intervention.</p>

<p>"I know you love me," she said, "and
always will. I too love you, but I don't
know yet how to do it well. I cannot tell
you what I feel. If you were at once to
speak to father, either he would say yes, or
he would say no, but in both cases you would
have to leave our house at once. Father is
no artist, he is a trader in music, and he is
meanspirited as all tradespeople are. He
does not understand love as artists do. He
would only see the impropriety of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
staying any longer with us. And I do not
want to be lonely. I want you with me.
Think only that I just found my heart. You
do love me?"</p>

<p>I wanted to take her in my arms, and
to kiss her again. But although there was
nobody in the street she prevented it.</p>

<p>"And you always will love me?" she
asked once more.</p>

<p>"Always, Mitzi!" I said.</p>

<p>And, my word, I am afraid that this
<i>always</i> still holds good a little.</p>

<p>When we arrived at home Doblana was
not yet in and Fanny had gone to bed. In
the drawing-room, where a couple of hours
before Mitzi had sung herself definitely into
my heart, we halted. She looked at me, and
I opened my arms; for a moment she laid
her cheek against my shoulder, then she took
my head between her hands and kissed me.
It was very sweet ... but it lacked Schubert.</p>

<p>Then she went into her room, and I into
mine.</p>

<p>It was she who the next day came to
speak about <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>"You want me to play <i>Lady Macbeth</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you not ask me for something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
heroic? Is <i>Lady Macbeth</i> not the
woman who tries to be stronger than man
and who breaks up from over-exertion? Can
you imagine anything more prodigious?"</p>

<p>"What am I to do with her?" she asked
again after a while. "I re-read <i>Macbeth</i>
last night. She is terrible. Think only,
she says that while her baby was smiling in
her face she would have dashed its brains
out, had she sworn to do it. I know that art
can receive a new meaning from all successive
generations, but how can a woman in
this century of longing for peace speak
words which were horrible even in those
times of torture?"</p>

<p>I was surprised at her question which
filled me with great happiness. She had
read <i>Macbeth</i> this very night. Was this not
a wonderful proof of her love? And she had
not read it superficially. Oh, what a happy
man I was to be able to call such a girl my
own!</p>

<p>But how to answer her question was
beyond me. All I could find to say was
this:</p>

<p>"You forget, Mitzi, that I will make
<i>Lady Macbeth</i> a beautiful, flexible cat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
first part, and a weak child in the second."</p>

<p>"My dear," she declared, "I fear that
that is rather an empty sentence, and that
you are not at all sure what you are going
to make her."</p>

<p>I felt that her remark was just, and I
resented her superiority a little. You see,
I was a composer; and as a composer I
believed that I need not <i>think</i> so very deeply,
if only I <i>felt</i> profoundly. I suppose that
most composers share this opinion, which
may be erroneous.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I am sure that if I had been
better at thinking (even at the cost of being
less good at feeling) Mitzi would have preferred
it. There were two Mitzis. The one
was a very pretty, charming girl, yet
probably somewhat insignificant. The other
was an eminent artist, gifted in many
respects. Instinctively it was the latter I
loved. But to love a woman means to conquer
her, not to be conquered. A superior
woman wants to be vanquished by a more
superior man. And I had capitulated
already to the pretty girl. As for the
artist, she simply annihilated me.</p>

<p>(The reader must not believe that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
war-like expressions are the result of my
entrenched authorship. If I were to use the
language which I have learned here I would
have first to publish a trench dictionary.
No&mdash;these expressions are only the result of
newspaper reading.)</p>

<p>Two days went by. Then Mr. Bischoff
called upon me and, as he wanted a thousand
crowns<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, he brought with him a detailed
sketch of his libretto.</p>

<p>Happily Doblana was absent, which
enabled Mitzi to assist at our interview.
I told Bischoff that it was my wish to see the
r√¥le of <i>Lady Macbeth</i> performed by Miss
Doblana, but that this must for the present
remain a secret to her father, who objected
to an artistic career for his daughter.</p>

<p>Bischoff inclined his head without
saying what he thought of my plan. Probably
his conviction was that I was mad to
confide my first work to a beginner, for this
was what people generally believed. How
many times have I been warned during the
following months not to commit my opera to
a "beginner"! But as it happened, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
great actor found that this "beginner"
knew very well what she wanted.</p>

<p>"I do not think, Mr. Bischoff," she said,
"that your libretto is any good, and should
it remain as it is, I will probably not undertake
to create the part of the lady."</p>

<p>"Oh!" answered Bischoff mockingly,
"you have not yet been on the boards, and
you already have a prima donna's caprices.
You will make your way!"</p>

<p>"There is no use in talking like this,"
she exclaimed. "If nobody yet has thought
of making a music drama of <i>Macbeth</i> there
are good reasons. By himself Macbeth is
a dull, heavy character."</p>

<p>Dear me! Bischoff's face!&mdash;You ought
to have seen it. It was worth while. He
took it personally&mdash;he out-shakespeared
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>"You are a very young girl," he said at
last, "to utter such criticism." And, turning
to me: "I did not expect, when I came
here, an adversary to whom I cannot speak
as I should like to on account of her sex.
It is most unfair."</p>

<p>"Neither my sex," cried Mitzi, "nor
my youth have anything to do with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you call my criticisms. At this moment I
am no woman. I am but an artist, and as
such I have the right to speak."</p>

<p>I should have gladly given whatever
money I had in my pocket to be somewhere
else; yet this very thought reminded me of
the fact that Bischoff would bear a little
more of Mitzi's argument, as there was a
cheque at the end of it.</p>

<p>But while I pondered over these possibilities
Mitzi was going on:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bischoff, Macbeth is a dull,
heavy person. He does not do anything by
himself. The witches who show him his
future do not influence him."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Fr√§ulein</i>, the witches are but a
symbol of his ambitious ideas."</p>

<p>"Never mind ... let us say then, that his
ambitious ideas do not lead him into action.
He must be dragged to it by his Lady. As a
great criminal he is entirely overshadowed
by her. Now, such a character may be
interesting in a spoken tragedy, but not in
music-drama. Further: Macduff is a typical
tenor, and as such never interesting.
Again, that fairy tale of Birnam wood coming
to Dunsinane, do you think that it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
impress a modern public?"</p>

<p>"So you are against our scheme altogether?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. But I want you to
make a <i>Lady Macbeth</i> instead of a <i>Macbeth</i>.
The Lady is the one interesting person in the
whole drama. I want you to cut out all
that does not concern her directly. I suggest
that you make the first scene of the
prophesy of the three witches, which is a
grand opening. Then must follow a first
act where at the beginning the Lady induces
Macbeth to commit the murder and where
at the end the deed is done. The second act
should be the banquet...."</p>

<p>"And Banquo's ghost? What will you
do with Banquo's ghost, if, as I suppose,
you suppress Banquo?"</p>

<p>"Let it be King Duncan's ghost. As
long as there is a ghost, it matters little
whose ghost it is. Finally, the third act
should be the scene where the Lady walks in
her sleep. After this the interest is over.
Let the public go home. It will have had
quite enough of the nightmare."</p>

<p>She stopped and there was a long
silence. The actor did not say one word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and I did not dare to interfere. I am
modest, I have reported that to you already.
If I were not, I might have told you that
Mitzi's plan, which certainly was good, was
my invention. But I am proud of being
modest and truthful.</p>

<p>At last Bischoff said:</p>

<p>"I apologise, <i>Fr√§ulein</i>, for having been
distrustful. Your scheme is workable."</p>

<p>"That is better, Mr. Bischoff," said my
dear girl with a most bewitching, yet triumphant
smile. "But I have not finished. I do
not want to impersonate a mere monster. I
consent to be a cat first, and a sick child
afterwards, but I must know why&mdash;I will
not be content with nice phrases. The Lady
will be my d√©but, and I want my d√©but to
be a triumph. Mr. Cooper does not seem to
know exactly how to explain. Will you?"</p>

<p>If Mitzi had shown her superiority up
to this moment, it was now Bischoff's turn.
As for me I had my favourite feeling: That
of being ... but why should I repeat it? You
know.</p>

<p class="b1">"It is only because your dull and
heavy Macbeth is compatible with my theory
of the Lady," began Bischoff, "that I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
give you the explanation you want. In my
idea Macbeth was not heavy, but irresolute.
Never mind, let him be heavy. In either
case, the Lady is obliged to put a steam
engine, if I may use this expression, in front
of all she says, to carry him away. However,
she shudders before her horrible words
and deeds. She seems to shut her eyes not
to see them. She is not a mere monster, to
quote your own words, she is a poor weak
woman, who loves that one man with such
strength, that she has been able to discover
all his failings, so that she may, with her
trembling body, cover and protect the imperfections.
You have only to search for her
tenderness and you will find it. It is, for
instance, with the utmost softness that you
must say the words:</p>

<p class="pp10il">
'Yet do I fear thy nature;<br />
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness ...<br />
... What thou would'st highly<br />
That would'st thou holily.'</p>

<p class="p1">And it is only because she feels kindness,
pity and peace in her heart that she calls
the spirits: '<i>Come you spirits, unsex me
here, and fill me top-full of direst cruelty</i>.'
Again, she suffers when she cries: <i>That my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
keen knife see not the wound it makes, nor
Heaven cry 'Hold, hold!'</i> And how happy
were she if she had known nothing of it all:
'<i>What beast was it then that made you break
this enterprise to me?</i>'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mitzi, "but immediately
afterwards she says those horrible words
about the babe...."</p>

<p class="b1">"That," answered Bischoff, "is effort.
That is one of the sentences where she uses
the steam engine to pull more vigorously.
That you must say as if you were shuddering
before your own words, as if you were feeling
that it is too much. In short, the
woman must continually appear under the
mask of the monster, and this is the reason
why I see the Lady cajoling her husband like
a beautiful, flexible cat during the scene
where she induces him to the murder. But
as soon as the deed is done she shows all her
weakness. Not to lose courage she has felt
obliged to drink. Nevertheless, she starts
at the slightest noise.</p>

<p class="pp10il">'Hark! Peace!<br />
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,<br />
Which gives the stern'st good-night.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">in these words! And does she not
confess that she is unable to commit the
crime herself, when she says these words,
which must be uttered with trembling love:</p>

<p class="pp10il">'Had he not resembled<br />
My father as he slept, I had done it.'</p>

<p class=" pn p1 b1">Thus the r√¥le must be played from beginning
to end, Lady Macbeth as a woman, a weak
woman, who knows her weakness:</p>

<p class="pp10il">'These deeds must not be thought<br />
After these ways; so, it will make us mad....'</p>

<p class="pn p1">a woman who at the end breaks down under
the stress of the effort she has made. You
must produce, as if by magic, love and pity
for Lady Macbeth in the hearts of the
audience, and never be a vulgar, awful criminal,
a Gorgon, as actresses generally understand,
or rather misunderstand the Lady."</p>

<p>"It will mean hard work," said Mitzi,
"but I am not afraid. I mean to do it."</p>

<p>And turning to me she added:</p>

<p>"You had better begin working."</p>

<p>Indeed, I started that very evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the bluest blue?</p>

<p>It is not the sky of Italy; it is not the
Sapphire of the Maharajah of Baipal, it is
not the Blue Diamond of the King of Siam,
nor is it the blue gentian that blooms on the
high Alps, it is not Rickett's blue,
it is not Prussian blue, which is,
parenthetically, out of fashion just now, nor
is it the blue of a tuppence highpenny stamp.
All these are blues. But the blues at the
front when it rains, these are the bluest
blues. And it never rains but it pours.</p>

<p>We sit there, the four of us, namely,
Charlie, Guncotton, Pringle, and I.</p>

<p>We smoke and feel miserable.</p>

<p>"It rains," states Guncotton.</p>

<p>"Does it?" asks Charlie.</p>

<p>"It does," answers Pringle, and I
finish the series with a:</p>

<p>"Rotten weather!"</p>

<p>A stillness follows.</p>

<p>We go on puffing, feeling thoroughly
soaked.</p>

<p>"It begins to be wet," says I.</p>

<p>"It's water," explains Guncotton.</p>

<p>"You are sure it isn't champagne?"
asks Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Champagne!" sighs Pringle dreamily.</p>

<p>And we fall back into taciturnity.</p>

<p>"By the way," asks Pringle, "Sergeant,
have you still got that bottle of
champagne?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I have."</p>

<p>"Well, as the official communiqu√© will
be that bad weather has hampered fighting
on the British front, why not go and fetch
the bottle and break its neck?"</p>

<p>"My friend," says Charlie solemnly,
"I have sworn an oath that I would not
open that bottle so long as I had not got
my commission!"</p>

<p>"You will not even open it to celebrate
the recovery of your nose?"</p>

<p>"I will not. I have not brought it all
the long way from the Dardanelles, through
Egypt and the Mediterranean to France,
only to forget my oath when I am so near
my goal!"</p>

<p>That bottle of champagne has a history.
When we were at the Dardanelles the Sergeant
had made himself a wonderful dugout,
quite a spacious room, magnificently
furnished with all sorts of empty cases. It
was quite a cosy place. Charlie had even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
caught a fox, that was his dog, and a kingfisher,
that was his canary. On the completion
of the abode we had a house warming.
We were six, namely, the four inseparables
whom you have the advantage of
knowing, plus an Australian and a French
guest.</p>

<p class="b1">The menu was:</p>

<p class="pn center"><b>SOUP.<br />
Oxo.</b></p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>ENTREE.<br />
Kidneys.</b></p>

<p class="pn">(obtained from the Butcher Sergeant in
return for a pair of braces which he wanted
badly.)</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>HORS D'≈íUVRES.</b></p>

<p class="pn">(Whilst we were eating our kidneys the
French guest arrived. He was late. So we
had the Hors d'≈ìuvres, which he brought
with him, after the Entr√©e.)</p>

<p class="pn center"><b>A Tin of Sardines.</b></p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>JOINT.<br />
Roast Chicken.</b></p>

<p class="pn">(This solid piece, the <i>chef-d'≈ìuvre</i>, was a
roast fowl, stolen by the Australian guest&mdash;poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
devil, I may make it public now, for
he's dead&mdash;from the General. What busines
had the General to keep chickens?)</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>ENTREMET.<br />
Omelette au Rum.</b></p>

<p class="pn">(The eggs were bought at the price of 1/-
each from a Greek trader who had come over
from Lemnos, but who had learned his trade
in a London provision shop. The rum was
Charlie's own savings for three weeks. Our
ration was one-eighth of a pint twice a week.)</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>DESSERT.<br />
Fruit.</b></p>

<p>from Lemnos, too, which was the only cheap
thing to be had there.</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>COFFEE.</b></p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn center"><b>WINES.</b></p>

<p class="pn40"><b>French wine,<br />
A bottle of whisky,<br />
And one of champagne.</b></p>

<p class="p1">That bottle of champagne had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
provided by Charlie. To get it, he had had
to swim a quarter of a mile, in order to reach
a certain ship&mdash;to swim with a sovereign in
his mouth. There were still some such
things as sovereigns in the world when this
affair took place. The sovereign was put in
a basket which had been lowered with a rope,
the basket pulled on deck and lowered again
with half a crown change and the bottle of
champagne. On his way back Charlie did
not know whether to spit his half crown out
or to swallow it, whether to let go the bottle
or not. For there was a heavy sea. But
somehow he reached the shore and landed
the bottle, the half crown and himself quite
safely.</p>

<p>Well, the dinner party in Charlie's dugout
went splendidly. But just at the
moment when we were about to open the
bottle of champagne, there was a surprise
attack from the Turks, a regular alarm, a
call to arms, (which I need not explain, as
"alarm" is only a perverted form of
<i>√† l'arme</i>!&mdash;to arms!).</p>

<p>"Never mind," cried Charlie, "We'll
drink the champagne another time, when I
get my commission. I swear I'll keep this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
bottle till then."</p>

<p>Since that day he has fulfilled his
promise. The bottle is the only thing he took
with him when we evacuated the Peninsula.</p>

<p>And now, when we have got the blues,
he refuses to open it. And, my word, our
blues are of a true blue, a Conservative blue.
Not the light blue of Cambridge, but the
dark blue of Oxford. We have even blue
blood in our veins, and call the Germans
Blue-beards. If we were to take any pills,
they would be blue pills. Our flag could be
the Blue Peter. And we have such a blue
funk, lest this confounded rain should never
cease, that we talk of our blues till we get
blue in the face. Not even Guncotton, who
is very skilled in pyrotechnics and has manufactured
a sort of little cartridge with which
he cleverly imitates Will-o'-the-wisps, is
able to enliven us. The daily display of
pyrotechnics of a somewhat more awe-inspiring
sort has rendered us positively cloyed
with that pleasure.</p>

<p>But Pringle, since Charlie's refusal to
open his bottle, has remained dreaming.
Finally he steals away. We wait five minutes,
ten minutes, a quarter of an hour. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the end he comes back holding a shell in his
arms. It is about four inches in diameter
and twelve in length. He settles down and
slowly starts unscrewing the fuse.</p>

<p>"Look out," warns Guncotton. "These
things explode sometimes...."</p>

<p>"That's just what I want," declares
Pringle tragically. "I want to put an end
to all this misery of ours."</p>

<p>Then, when the shell is unscrewed, he
passes it to the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Have a drop?" he asks.</p>

<p>The shell goes round.</p>

<p>"Our blues turn pink," says I.</p>

<p>"Like litmus paper under the influence
of an acid," explains Guncotton.</p>

<p>"Acid?" asks Pringle reproachfully.
"It's brandy. The best brandy possible."</p>

<p>"French brandy," says I.</p>

<p>"<i>Vive la France!</i>" cries Charlie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have had another fight ... a day of manifold
horrors and of deafening explosions.
We have killed many Germans and many of
our own homes were put into mourning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
shall make no attempt at describing this
battle. It is over, thank God, and I turn
from its monstrosities to my peaceful occupation
of remembering what happened in
days gone by.</p>

<p>I was perfectly happy in spite of the
fact that Mitzi had no overflowing heart.
You will be good enough to remember that
on the day of our first meeting in the railway
carriage P.C. 3.33 she remained clad in
mystery all the way from Salzburg to
Vienna, and that, while I told her all about
myself, I did not learn anything about her.
This more or less repeated itself now. I let
her peep into the inmost recesses of my
heart, and there is certainly nobody who has
such a complete acquaintance with that
organ of mine, which circulates my blood,
my feelings, my thoughts.</p>

<p>Mitzi's heart remained ever an unknown
quantity to me. I think this is a bad habit
of woman. Dad always pretends that
there is a corner of the mater's heart into
which Daniel Cooper &amp; Co., Ltd., have never
penetrated. I am afraid this corner is the
most important one of a woman's heart. Nobody
ever explores it, not even the woman to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
whom the heart belongs. Perhaps she dares
not.</p>

<p>So it was with Mitzi. She was sweet,
and I am sure she loved me; yet she kept
her secret corner hermetically closed. There
was no need of writing on that heart:
Trespassers will be prosecuted, for there was
no possibility of trespassing.</p>

<p>If I were not so modest I should say that
what she most loved in me was my musical
talent. I had an experience of this on the
morrow of that interview which had taken
place between her, Bischoff, and myself.</p>

<p>"Are you going to see Bischoff?" she
asked as I was to leave for what we called
my lesson with Hammer.</p>

<p>I answered that it had not been my
intention, but that I might see my collaborator
if she had any particular wish.</p>

<p>"I have," she said. "Your <i>Lady
Macbeth</i> scarcely leaves me a restful minute.
I have thought that it will be very difficult
to show the weak, feminine side of the part
in music, without a certain external help."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this?" I asked.</p>

<p class="b1">"I mean some lyrical detail which in
my opinion must be added. Could the words</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp10il">
'I have given suck, and know<br />
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.'</p>

<p class="pn p1">could these words not be the excuse for a
sort of lullaby? And then in the scene
where she walks in her sleep; as we have
cancelled all Macduff, the Lady can no more
say: '<i>The thane of Fife had a wife; where
is she now?</i>' But I think the lullaby could
be repeated in her dream. It would be, when
it comes first, only a remembrance, and when
it comes for the second time only the dream-memory
of that remembrance. It would
have to be very mysterious and so in keeping
with the general character of the whole
drama."</p>

<p>Mitzi's idea may give you a notion of
her artistic instinct. Perhaps I ought not
to call it artistic, but theatrical or operatic.
For, although the idea was excellent and
proved so, its staginess, its artificiality
cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I was then enthusiastic about
it. I went to Hammer, who advised as
accompaniment for this not yet composed
lullaby a succession of major thirds in the
lowest notes of the flutes; a suggestion which
I applied, but not without the greatest difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in the first version of that little piece,
while when it came back in the dream scene
I replaced the flutes by muted violins. I
remember this detail, because when <i>Lady
Macbeth</i> was performed, Hammer came
greatly excited after the first act to me protesting
that his advice had been bad, and the
highest notes of the bassoons would have
been better than the lowest of the flutes,
whereupon I told him in my excusable excitement
that I did not care, or, to employ the
Austrian expression, and that it was all
"sausage to me."</p>

<p>Indulgent reader, do not be cross with
me because I speak of these professional
details. Having shown you sufficiently that
I am no more a musician, I may be allowed
to remember that once upon a time I was
one.</p>

<p>I ran to Bischoff. And so pleased was
he with Mitzi's suggestion that he wrote
there and then the words of that lullaby. In
the afternoon I worked with Mr. Doblana
on the score of his <i>Aladdin</i>, which was
advancing rapidly and in my judgment
becoming a distinctly charming ballet.</p>

<p>Then only did I find time to compose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
lullaby. It is a weird yet tuneful little piece
which took me but half an hour to write
down.</p>

<p>When Mitzi heard it she was enraptured.
She let herself fall in my arms and looked
at me with loving eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh Patrick," she said, "you will
write a masterpiece for me, won't you?"</p>

<p>I promised. Never had I felt so much
sympathy between us.</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Mitzi," I replied,
"for I love you, love you truly, you are my
better self, you are my good angel."</p>

<p>She laughed. Yes, she laughed at my
fervent words.</p>

<p>"How solemn you are, Patrick. How
English. You declaim as if you wanted to
appeal to my passions."</p>

<p>"Mitzi, I cannot help worshipping you.
No woman can wish to be loved better than
I love you."</p>

<p>I found my words quite nice and the
right thing to say. But she went on
laughing.</p>

<p>"I can make any man say that to me.
But I doubt whether I can make any man
compose a beautiful opera. Will you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is my lullaby not to your taste?"</p>

<p>She seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>"One swallow does not make a summer."</p>

<p>I felt it like a bitter pang, as if I were
forsaken by her. Artists are such sensitive
plants. Oh, imaginative reader, fancy your
Patrick Cooper as a Mimosa whose leaves
have just been touched. My life seemed
pale, my prospects desolate, my hopes dead.
And all that because Mitzi had laughed when
my heart had been glowing.</p>

<p>Yet the phenomena of irritability last
but one moment in the Mimosa, and the
subtle doom that had struck my love lasted
not much longer.</p>

<p>Now, when writing this I see how fearfully
weak I was.</p>

<p>A few days later, the holidays at the
Opera having begun, Doblana and Mitzi left
for a little place in the Salzkammergut,
St. Gilgen, not far from Salzburg, and I for
England, where I was to stay for a few weeks
with my parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">IX.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The mater had suffered from rheumatism,
and therefore Harrogate
had been chosen as a summer
resort. Besides, at that time,
there still existed a Mrs. Dicks, who was
always liverish and who had been ordered to
Harrogate, too. Mrs Dicks was the best
soul you could imagine, but a very plain
woman. Yet when she died a couple of
years after the events I am recording, her
husband mourned her deeply. To anybody
who wanted to hear it he stated that he had
lost the best of wives and Bean the best of
mothers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Dicks were great
friends, which provided (in the form of endless
chats) some consolation for their forced
stay at Harrogate. For I cannot think that
anybody would go to Harrogate if he was
not obliged. Perhaps it was because I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
straight from Vienna, which is surrounded
by the most lovely villages and woods, I
could not find the slightest charm in the
tedious landscape of Harrogate with its tiny
heath and nearly invisible pine forest.
After what I used to hear in Vienna, the so-called
music in the Valley Gardens appeared
to me a parody without any sense of fun.
And after the fragrance of the air on the
<i>Kahlenberg</i>, in the <i>Br√ºhl</i>, or on the <i>Eisernes
Thor</i>, where I had made excursions, the
rotten egg perfume of the sulphur springs
at Harrogate was simply repulsive.</p>

<p>And then, instead of Mitzi, I had Bean.
She was at that time a mere kid of twelve,
just beginning to be a flapper. I have
generally been shy with young ladies, and
have avoided their company. But I never
have considered Miss Violet Dicks a young
lady. She just was Bean&mdash;and is still.</p>

<p>You will have noticed that my modesty
has hitherto prevented me from giving a
detailed description of your humble servant's
physical charms. Be it sufficient for you to
know that there were at Harrogate many
ladies whose profession, not to call it trade,
was to be young. Ladies who used to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their eyes rest with all signs of satisfaction
on my tall and evidently handsome figure.</p>

<p>Being afraid (I think you can fancy my
feelings) I used Bean as a shield. I would
not take a walk without her by my side to
protect me from some suppositious attack by
one of the ladies, in whom I saw so many
birds of prey. I daresay it was dreadfully
mean of me to misuse the child like this.
For when we rambled along the fields I
scarcely spoke, absorbed as I was in the
mental work on <i>Lady Macbeth</i>, an effort that
never ceased. Yet, although I took so little
notice of her, the child's eyes were always
shining, and whenever she spoke her voice
was thirsting with excitement.</p>

<p>Once I asked her if my taciturnity did
not annoy her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she answered, "it is just
splendid to be with you. I know you think
of music. You listen to your thoughts. One
day I will listen to your music. I am
waiting. I won't get impatient."</p>

<p>"Should you like to know the plot of
my opera?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be just delightful!"</p>

<p>Just splendid. Just delightful. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was her way of expressing herself.</p>

<p>I told her the story of <i>Lady Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>"I am sure," she said when I had
finished, "if you do it, it will be very beautiful.
This evening, will you play that lullaby
to me?"</p>

<p>I objected, for I did not like to play the
piano at the hotel where we would be at once
surrounded by these offensive acquaintances
you are compelled to make in watering-places.
But Bean begged so much that in
the end I yielded.</p>

<p>While I was playing she seemed pale
and strangely spiritual, watching me with
adoring eyes. When I had finished she said
nothing. Not one word. But when shortly
afterwards she went to bed we shook hands,
and I noticed that her's was as cold as ice.</p>

<p>"Good night, kiddy," I said.</p>

<p>She only pressed my hand a little harder,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>The two maters noticing, of course, the
incident and greatly exaggerating its importance,
found in it some fuel for the
cherished hopes that were burning in their
breasts.</p>

<p>There was some more of that fuel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
store. For when Bean and I went a few
days later to Knaresborough, where I offered
her a little row, what if she did not go and
upset the boat, so that our row became a
swim!</p>

<p>She uttered an imploring cry, but the
next moment I had her in my arms. She
clung to me quite desperately, her slender
little body shaken by fright one moment, by
a storm of laughter the next. The situation
was not without danger, and the anxiety in
my own heart made me rather tender with
the kid. Yet, we safely reached the shore,
where she lay exhausted, her hands keeping
their hold of me, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh Pat ... Pat ... how brave you are...."</p>

<p>And after a while she added:</p>

<p>"I knew you were brave, when I heard
that you were going to tackle <i>Lady
Macbeth</i>."</p>

<p>From that moment I was so much f√™ted,
so often called a hero, so incessantly praised
for having saved Bean's life, that I took to
flight. I did not even wait till the parents
returned to London.</p>

<p>At the station Bean pushed a few roses
in my hand. She seemed serious, and I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
her tiny fingers tremble.</p>

<p>"You'll keep them?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I will, kiddy."</p>

<p>Reader, you must by now be well aware
of my character, and therefore know that I
kept the roses. However, as the petals have
gone, all I still possess is the stalks. I
think this detail would interest you, for I
know you all sympathize with Bean.</p>

<p>I think I also ought to tell you that I
had given Dad a hint&mdash;although only a
delicate one&mdash;of what he had to prepare for,
concerning Mitzi. Dad and I had never had
any secrets from each other, and there was
a really chummy relation between us both.
I confess that I understood nothing of his
Insurance schemes, yet I never objected to
any of them. I was in consequence rather
surprised to find him a little cool when I
spoke about my Austrian love. He pretended
that I was speaking only of my
future primadonna, not of my promised
bride, and even for the former he showed a
certain mistrust. Once more I heard the
old story that it was dangerous to confide
the success of my opera to a beginner. Of
course, I forgave him, for it was his r√¥le,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
being the eldest, to be careful. And then,
he did not know Mitzi.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the little I had said about her
prevented me from staying at Doblana's
house as I had done before, and though Mitzi
objected I had to tell the horn-player the
reason. I was much too much imbued with
the English idea of a long engagement not to
have been taken completely by surprise when
his first question was, On what date did I
intend to fix the marriage. However,
although I could only answer that I had not
yet thought of it, but that I hoped Mitzi
would not oblige me to wait more than a year
or eighteen months, he received my invitation
to regard me as his future son-in-law fairly
well.</p>

<p>As I have already intimated, Mitzi did
not seem at all pleased. She pretended that
I had robbed her, by speaking so early to her
father, of all the sweetness of our secret
love. And I am sure we would have quarrelled
over this point had I not remembered
of a saying of my dear dad, that married
life was an uninterrupted series of concessions,
and had I not applied this principle
also to the time preceding the marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another reason for my forbearance:
a composer must hold his temper
in check with his primadonna. It was,
however, more difficult than one may think,
for I found Mitzi on my return to Austria
altogether ... somewhat changed.</p>

<p>You will remember that the late Mrs.
Doblana had on her death-bed implored her
husband to let bygones be bygones, and to
reconcile himself with the Archduke Alphons
Hector and his children. Up to now the
horn-player had refused. But as the
moment of the performance of his <i>Aladdin</i>
was approaching, his highly developed sense
for all that touched his interests told him
that a more conciliatory attitude would be
advisable. His sojourn at St. Gilgen, at a
short distance from Salzburg, was probably
not chosen without intention, and whilst he
did not himself see Franz and Augusta von
Heidenbrunn, he tacitly consented to Mitzi
frequenting them freely.</p>

<p>You will perhaps remember that I had
a certain mistrust of the Countess Augusta.
On what that mistrust was based I am quite
incapable of saying. It was mere instinct.
But I have always noticed that girls, as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as they were friends, had secrets. And
these secretive manners have, in my idea, an
evil influence on their morals.</p>

<p>It is to the influence of Augusta von
Heidenbrunn that I attributed the fact of
finding Mitzi, as I have said, altogether ...
somewhat changed. This expression must
not be taken as funny. She was changed
very little indeed, but that little change
affected her through and through. I still
knew little of women, but I would have been,
say, colour-blind had I not noticed that
something had happened.</p>

<p>She had always liked to go out, but now
the number of errands which obliged her to
be away from home had increased enormously.
I had thought that our London cook
held a record for outings&mdash;still, Mitzi beat
her.</p>

<p>Again, she had always been nicely
dressed, but now the care she took of her
toilet had increased tenfold.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I arrived at the Karlsgasse
I found her pensive, not to say gloomy,
at other times excitedly merry.</p>

<p>When I asked her that inevitable question:
"You love me?" which I am sure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
asked a hundred times a day between any
engaged couple, she still answered that she
did and knew her love was not good enough;
but she also added that she was my <i>friend</i>,
and that her <i>friendship</i> should be a pillar for
our future happiness. Sometimes her
tenderness was overflowing, sometimes she
she was sulky and inscrutable.</p>

<p>Once, after one more unsuccessful trial at
singing my song <i>Breathes there a man</i>, I
signified my regret and my doubt whether
she would ever be able to express what I had
tried to indicate in that song. Thereupon
she declared that her singing was much too
good for my song.</p>

<p>"That is entirely true," was my answer,
"but you should not say so."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," she retorted, "I think that
in matters artistic I reason at least as closely
and rightly as you; and in these questions
one may always rely in preference on a
woman's judgment. Women possess infinitely
more delicacy."</p>

<p>"Say that you dislike that song...."</p>

<p>"I will never say that, because I like
everything you compose. But am I not free
to sing what I choose?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>All this frivolous cavilling was unimportant.
I remembered Daniel Cooper and
his female partner. There cannot be a
couple better mated than these two. I don't
think that they ever quarrelled, but there
was a continuous wrangling over small,
insignificant details, a miniature feud, just
enough to prevent monotony. Evidently
my married life was to be a similar one.</p>

<p>Yet, once there arose such a difference
between Mitzi and me that I was afraid lest
it should mean the breaking off of our match.</p>

<p>I hope that you have still some slight
remembrance of what we will call "The
Mystery of the Griseldis score." Anyhow,
if you have forgotten, neither Mr. Doblana
nor his daughter had. He always treated
her with the same coldness. I, of course,
could not notice it, as I had never seen them
on more friendly terms, but Mitzi often complained
of his indifference. And it was only
too natural that "The Mystery of the
Griseldis score" should return again and
again in our talk, as it had been the origin
of our love.</p>

<p>Well, as <i>Lady Macbeth</i> was advancing
rapidly, it became necessary to find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
theatre for its first performance, and as I
had not the slightest experience in theatrical
business, and as Mr. Doblana assured me
that there were at the Imperial Opera enough
new things accepted to fill at least two years
(his <i>Aladdin</i> amongst others) I decided to
accept the services of a theatrical agent. Mitzi
advised me to go to Giulay. Indeed, he had
the reputation of being very clever. But
every agent has. Nor was it his quasi-celebrity
that induced me to call upon him.
It was the fact that I still held that his part
in "The Mystery of the Griseldis score" had
been deeper than Mitzi suspected.</p>

<p>I called upon him and found him to my
surprise completely businesslike. He was
still ugly, and his voice loud and discordant,
but he did not in his office tell any funny
yarns as he used to do at the Round Table.
That he was clever, there could not be the
slightest doubt, for in scarcely a week's time
he had induced the manager of the Br√ºnn
municipal theatre to play my opera. At the
same time he also settled that Mitzi was to
make her d√©but as Lady Macbeth. Mitzi, or
as she was called in the contract, Amizia
Dobanelli. Four performances were mutually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
guaranteed&mdash;by the manager to be performed&mdash;by
me to be paid for should the
receipts not be sufficient.</p>

<p>Please, merciful reader, spare me; and
do not enquire about the other points of that
contract. They were so many humiliations.
It would make me blush. Still it was a contract,
and I confess, I would not have been
able to get it by myself.</p>

<p>My business with Giulay had been the
pretext for much intercourse, and my desire
to know him better had determined me to
see him more often than was strictly
necessary.</p>

<p>One day I found an old lady in his office.
Like Giulay, she wore a lot of jewellery, like
Giulay she had a discordant voice. And
from one particularity, namely, from the
extraordinary amount of refractory black
hair which grew in her nose I could make a
guess at some consanguinity. As a matter
of fact she was his mother, and in spite of
her negative beauty seemed to be a decent
sort. Giulay made a fuss about me and my
opera, and the result was an invitation to
come and lunch on the following Sunday
with the two Hungarian people at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
home in the Maroccanergasse. This street,
although situated in a fashionable quarter,
was far from smart, the principal reason for
this being that one side was filled nearly in
the whole of its length by the ugliest barracks
in the whole town. So at least the
negative beauty of the two Giulays was in
harmony with their surroundings. Nor was
the house where they lived one of the palatial
buildings of which you see so very many in
Vienna. It was a modest dwelling, one of
those habitations where fortunes are made
rather than spent. There was no marble
hall, no carpet in the stairs, no electric light.
Still it was very decent. In the third story
of this house my hosts had their abode.</p>

<p>When I rang the bell, Maurus Giulay
himself came to open the door. The
apartment had an air of stinginess which
contrasted with its jewel-bedecked inhabitants.
It was all respectable and without
any artistic taste, the right lodging for small
people. Only one detail struck me as
remarkable, namely, that the walls of the
drawing-room were entirely covered with
photographs. There were artists and
artistes, authors and composers, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
famous and most unknown. Whether there
was any wall paper beneath these photos I
could not say; probably there was, but it
had certainly not proved sufficiently hideous.</p>

<p>The meal was scanty and pretended to
be refined. We had about two dessert-spoonfuls
of soup served in coffee cups, then
a little anchovy paste on tiny pieces of toast
as a hors d'≈ìuvre, and one whiting between
us three. I must say that the old lady
hardly ate anything, busy as she was waiting
upon us two gentlemen. Yet it looked
rather funny, that solitary whiting, as did
afterwards the two thrushes for three,
accompanied by a little salad adorned with
a hard egg, which was cut into quarters, so
that there was even one too many. And
then there was a little cheese, a little butter,
with a little bread, and a little fruit, very
little, and some coffee in mocha cups, viz.:
smaller cups than those which had served for
the soup.</p>

<p>There was also in the centre of the table
a cake, rather a large cake, if you please,
and to be candid, I had enjoyed the prospect
of having some. I daresay I would have
endured it. But none was offered, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
this day I do not know whether it was a
dummy or a real one, and in the latter case
whether it was one they had kept from one
year to the other for such festivities, or if
it was to serve for another party in the
evening.</p>

<p>Yet, I must not get too slanderous, for
there was at least one thing I enjoyed
thoroughly: a Coronas cigar that Giulay
offered me. It is not an expensive cigar,
costing about sixpence, but I recommend it
to the few Englishmen who will, after the
war, visit Austria.</p>

<p>While I was smoking it, Mrs. Giulay
apologized for her lunch and especially for
her waiting upon us.</p>

<p>"You see," said she, "it is not at all
easy to be at the same time cook, housemaid,
and hostess. But I am used to having
no servants. When Maurus was born, his
father was a dying man. I was left very
poor. I have had to struggle badly to give
my boy a sound commercial education. I
could not afford a servant girl during these
hard times. Ten years ago he opened his
agency and was at once very successful.
Still for several years the utmost economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was necessary. Then the habit was formed;
and I cannot get myself used to the idea of
having a servant."</p>

<p>I did not, on the moment, reflect on this
story. I only said to myself that one must
not judge people by appearances, and that
Mrs. Giulay was a more worthy woman than
I had at first conceived.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when I had left them, I
meditated how little progress I had made by
my connexion with Giulay in the "Mystery
of the Griseldis score." And then, suddenly,
an idea struck me which would have made
me go immediately to the Karlsgasse if it
had not been a Sunday, and if I had not
known that the person who unexpectedly had
become very important in my clue, was then
not to be found there.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, saw me at
Doblana's house. He was not in, Monday
mornings being regularly devoted to orchestra
rehearsals at the Opera.</p>

<p>I asked Mitzi to call Fanny and to be
present at the interview I wished to have
with the maid. Mitzi, of course, laughed at
my seriousness, but summoned the girl, who
came, smiling and plump as always.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fanny," I began, "do you remember,
when we first investigated the affair of
<i>Fr√§ulein's</i> visit to Salzburg, that you said,
you knew that it was then a month since
Mr. Giulay had left Vienna even for half a
day?"</p>

<p>Fanny did not answer.</p>

<p>"Surely you remember?" I asked
again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said.</p>

<p>"And I wanted to know," said Mitzi,
"<i>how</i> you knew this?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said I, and turning again to
Fanny, "And what did you answer?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>Again the girl remained silent.</p>

<p>"You said," I went on, "that you had
made friends with the cook of Mrs. Giulay."</p>

<p>"I did not," declared Fanny instantly.</p>

<p>"How can you say so?" cried Mitzi.
"I distinctly remember that you did."</p>

<p>Fanny insisted on her denial. I
remained for a moment impressively silent.</p>

<p>"And what if I did?" finally demanded
the servant who by now had ceased smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is very simple," I declared,
"Mrs. Giulay has no cook."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"She had one at that time."</p>

<p>"No. She has had no cook, nor other
servant, for thirty-five years."</p>

<p>Fanny seemed smitten with uneasiness,
and I went on:</p>

<p>"Well, as you did not learn what you
stated from that imaginary cook, who then
did you learn it from?"</p>

<p>"I do not remember the whole affair,"
she returned doggedly.</p>

<p>I made a beautiful gesture with my hand
and turned to Mitzi.</p>

<p>"A short time before I went to England
I found out what had so much upset your
father. Your visit to Salzburg had been
used for foul play; during your absence
your father's score of <i>Griseldis</i> had been
stolen."</p>

<p>"What?" cried both women.</p>

<p>"It is so," I continued. "Mr. Doblana
suspects that it was stolen with <i>Fr√§ulein</i>
Mitzi's support. This, and the desire of the
Archduke that no fuss should be made in
which his name would necessarily be involved
has prevented police inquiries. But
I do not share Mr. Doblana's opinion. I
thought and, of course, still think, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<i>Fr√§ulein</i> Mitzi is absolutely innocent. I
believed then that the Salzburg wire had
been sent by the Comtesse Augusta...."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mitzi.</p>

<p>"I believed so until yesterday. I
apologize now; my suspicion was evidently
erroneous. I also thought that for some
unknown reason Mr. Giulay had stolen the
score...."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mitzi again.</p>

<p>And Fanny protested vigorously:</p>

<p>"It is not true!"</p>

<p>"In this part," I declared, "I feel
unable to give in. My proof is that Fanny
tried to protect Mr. Giulay by telling us
that story of the cook, and again tries to
shield him now."</p>

<p>"What else?" asked Fanny ironically.</p>

<p>"Fanny and Giulay," I concluded
triumphantly, "acted in agreement. Fanny
was in Giulay's service, was his accomplice.
Her leave had begun on the Friday morning.
She went at once to Salzburg from where
she sent the wire. There is a train leaving
Vienna at ten o'clock which arrives at three
in Salzburg. <i>Fr√§ulein</i> received the wire at
about five. It fits to a nicety."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not true!" cried the maid again,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Then why," prompted I, "why did
you tell that story of the cook? Why did
you declare that you knew that it was a
month since Mr. Giulay had left Vienna even
for half a day?"</p>

<p>She sniffed.</p>

<p>"Fanny," said Mitzi gently, "you have
always been a good girl. Why did you tell
these lies?"</p>

<p>Fanny sniffed more. With her nose,
with her mouth, with all her throat. If it
had been possible she would have sniffed with
her ears. But there came no reply.</p>

<p>"Fanny," repeated Mitzi, "you see
that appearances are all against you."</p>

<p>A paroxysm of sniffing answered, while
the girl assented with her head, and her
tears redoubled. Who would have thought
she had so much water in her?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"You must tell us the truth," insisted
Mitzi. "You will understand that by your
silence you only strengthen the suspicion
which lies upon you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pause. And then, suddenly,
Fanny turned upon me with clenched
fists, her wet face purple with rage. She
trembled with anger.</p>

<p>"What did I do to you," she said with a
cry of exasperation, "that you should come
and wrong me so? I am no thief, nor is Mr.
Giulay. He has not taken the music, nor
have I sent the wire ..."</p>

<p>"But, Fanny," interrupted Mitzi.</p>

<p>"No <i>Fr√§ulein</i>, it's no use ... you won't
prove anything. The young gentleman
wants to know the truth. Well, I will say
the truth: I used to walk out with Mr.
Giulay ..."</p>

<p>Mitzi and I were speechless at this
revelation.</p>

<p>"... and during these three days we were
on the Semmering<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> together and didn't leave
each other for a minute. That's all. And
now, <i>Fr√§ulein</i> will be good enough to take
my notice."</p>

<p>With these words Fanny left the room.
And then another tempest burst. This time
I was the victim. I will not give you many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
details. But you may imagine Mitzi's state
of mind. She had in one minute, as the
result of Fanny's confession, lost a good
maid who had faithfully served her for six
years, and seen her belief in her esteemed
friend Giulay ruined, Giulay, who was
carrying on a love affair with such a low
class girl. And all that through me, without
my having even succeeded in finding a
solution for "The Mystery of the Griseldis
score."</p>

<p>I will add here that Fanny informed her
fancy gentleman of the whole discussion, and
how I had suspected her and him. You will
not be surprised to hear that the theatrical
agent's interest in me and my work disappeared
there and then, and that he did not
undertake one more step for me.</p>

<p>But this is only a secondary matter.
For the present the avalanche of reproaches
that fell on me was quite sufficient. A
regular scene took place between Mitzi and
her detective-composer. (For wasn't I a
student in both these callings, of which I
can only say that either is the worse?)</p>

<p>You, who have been kind enough to read
these confessions, you know that I gave my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
inmost heart to the composition of my <i>Lady
Macbeth</i>, and you will learn only too soon
how I fared. So much for the composer.
Now for the detective. You also know with
what care I investigated "The Mystery of
the Griseldis score," how patiently I waited
and kept my suspicions for myself as long
as I was not sure. If in the end I was
deceived by appearances, if I made a
blunder, was it my fault? What business
had Fanny to walk out with Giulay, and
Mitzi to embark upon an operatic career
against the wish of her father?</p>

<p>Well, we were very busy, Mitzi saying
nasty things to me, and I trying to soften
her, when we heard Mr. Doblana's key
turning in the lock. He was coming home
from his rehearsal. Then we perceived the
noise of a smaller key. He was opening the
letter box. And after a minute he walked
in, finding us seated in two opposite corners
of the room, as far as possible from each
other&mdash;Mitzi looking sullen&mdash;I meek.</p>

<p>And he? Gracious me, what a sour
face he made. He walked up and down for
a minute or so, and if there had been on our
part the slightest wish to talk, we would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
have dared to do it, so cheerful did he look.</p>

<p>At last he mumbled a few words about
treachery, respect due by the children and
so on, and after these short preliminaries the
storm, the third one of the day, broke forth.
He had just received a letter from the
manager of the Br√ºnn municipal theatre.
Miss Doblana not being of age, her father
was required to endorse the contract.</p>

<p>My word, he was in a rage. No!&mdash;he
was not going to give his consent to such
utter folly. He was indignant at being
deceived in this way.</p>

<p>"Have I not a thousand times expressed
my wish that you should not go on the
stage?"</p>

<p>"Oh," answered Mitzi sweetly, "you
have certainly done it more than a thousand
times. But I have failed to understand
why."</p>

<p>"Is the example of your unhappy aunt,
of La Carina, not enough?"</p>

<p>"My mother, too, was an operatic
singer."</p>

<p>"I do not speak of your mother, I speak
of your aunt."</p>

<p>"Well, what of her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was her's not a life of shame?"</p>

<p>"I feel unable to see it in that light."</p>

<p>"Was your mother not ashamed of her?
Did she not for years hide from me the mere
existence of your aunt Kathi, of La Carina?
Was I not cheated by your mother every day
exactly as I have now been cheated once more
by you? And what for? I ask you, what for?
Do you think that every she-cat that walks
miaowing over the boards will find an
Archduke?"</p>

<p>I thought that it was time for me to
step into the battle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Doblana," I declared, "Mitzi is
to sing <i>Lady Macbeth</i> in my opera."</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooper," he returned sharply,
"Mitzi will do nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"You forget that all has been arranged
with the manager of the theatre."</p>

<p>"I forget? Really? Do I? What a
bad memory I have. It is true. I forget.
I even forget that I was consulted on behalf
of my daughter. No, Mr. Cooper, I know
Mitzi better than you do, better than anybody
does, and I forbid her to go on the
stage. She has not the moral force of her
mother. She is as weak as her aunt was."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Mitzi had turned her back to us and was
drumming on the window panes. I admired
her once more&mdash;I cannot sufficiently repeat
how pretty she was from ... behind, too.</p>

<p>"And, Mr. Doblana, if I beg of you to
let her sing the <i>Lady Macbeth</i>, which I have
written especially for her, if I beseech you
to permit it?"</p>

<p>"I will say no. You would be the first
to repent it. Mitzi has no moral strength.
A girl who supports her father's enemies."</p>

<p>Mitzi turned sharply round.</p>

<p>"Father!" she protested in a husky
voice, "I know that I owe you respect. But
such calumny cannot be allowed."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Mitzi," I said gently, "let
me do the talking."</p>

<p>And turning to Doblana I declared so
firmly that I hardly recognized my own
voice:</p>

<p>"Either you will give your consent to
Mitzi singing <i>Lady Macbeth</i>, or I will marry
her within a month, even against your will
if it must be, and I will then be the one
master to decide whether she may or may
not go on the stage."</p>

<p>My unexpected vigour had a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
effect. Doblana gave in, and Mitzi became
reconciled with me. I may even say that she
never before had loved me so well as she did
after that third thunderstorm. And she
gave me of her own free will a photograph of
hers for which I had long begged in vain.</p>

<p>While she still held it in her hand she
asked me:</p>

<p>"So, when we will be married, you will
be my absolute master?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mitzi."</p>

<p>"I will be your property, your thing,
all yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mitzi."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Am I not yours already?"</p>

<p>She kissed me. Then she took the
photo, and wrote across it: "<i>Meinem</i>
Patrick, <i>seine</i> Mitzi"&mdash;"To <i>my</i> Patrick, <i>his</i>
Mitzi."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sergeant Young, who pursues the story
of my Austrian love with the greatest interest
asks me:</p>

<p>"Have you still got that photo?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Would it not make a good frontispiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
for your book if ever it is printed?"</p>

<p>"A frontispiece?"</p>

<p>Of course, I am greatly surprised at this
question. When an author, even if he is a
former composer and at present a Lance-Corporal,
writes a book he does not think of
such paltry things as the frontispiece. And
then&mdash;it is quite bad enough to show to an
inquisitive reader my heart, or whatever
name you like to give to that organ.... But
her face!... Mitzi's face?...</p>

<p>You see, something curious has happened.
When I started writing this I was
still in the power of Mitzi's charm. Slowly
I have been made to feel that I am setting
myself free from it. I write the whole adventure
off my heart, with all its joys and all its
sorrows. Yet I cannot make up my mind
to give away her features. But, if really
these pages one day do appear in print, and
if you find Mitzi's photo reproduced as the
frontispiece&mdash;then, affectionate reader, you
will know that writing my story has cured
me altogether, completely.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Sergeant wants to
see the photo. So I visit my kit bag.
Therein is a parcel. All it contains is three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
photos and ... I may as well tell you, as you
know all about it ... the stalks of those roses
Bean gave me so long ago. The three photos
are Pa, Ma, and Mitzi. (I hope you did not
expect them to be Messrs. Hammer, Doblana
and Giulay.)</p>

<p>The three photos are well wrapped first
in some tissue paper, then in a considerable
amount of strong brown paper, and finally
in a sheet of oil cloth. Thus they have been
able to stand the fatigues of war.</p>

<p>I show the Sergeant first the face of
Daniel Cooper, and then that of the mater.
He remains rather indifferent, but says
politely:</p>

<p>"They seem to be nice people."</p>

<p>The stalks of Bean's roses, I show him
not.</p>

<p>But I uncover Mitzi' s likeness.</p>

<p>Charlie looks at it and frowns. After a
while he gives it back to me.</p>

<p>"Well?" I ask.</p>

<p>He does not reply. But suddenly he
gets up.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me," he says.</p>

<p>And he goes.</p>

<p>What's the matter now?</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">X.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">I cannot conceive anything so fascinating
in an operatic composer's life as
the rehearsals of a new work of his.
When he first hears in reality the
tunes, the harmonies, the combinations of
sounds which he had up to that moment
heard only in his fancy, a profound terror
overcomes him. The positive, actual
achievements of the singers and the orchestra
are so far from the ideal abstractions his
fancy had supposed. Can it be possible that
this shapeless noise should represent his
score? The melodies are hardly recognizable,
erroneous intentions of the singers
deteriorate the musical sense, wrong notes
hurt the poor composer's ears. But by and
by the whole thing improves. Mistakes are
corrected, the meanings of musical phrases
are explained and the distress of the unhappy
man vanishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>I will not tell you the alarm, the consternation
of Patrick Cooper when, at the
beginning of the rehearsals, his masterpiece&mdash;for
secretly, in the inmost recess of
his heart, he considered <i>Lady Macbeth</i> as a
masterpiece&mdash;appeared to him to be not only
disorganized, but thoroughly rotten.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried he silently, and his sufferings
were all the more formidable as his
vociferations were so very silent, "oh, why
did I disobey my good mother? Why did I
not follow the ideal career of an insurance
broker? Why did I not foresee these
shocking experiences? It is all horrible,
appalling, awful!"</p>

<p>But later, when the aspect began to
change, when the figures I had created took
form, when the howlings, the shrieks, the
screams became music, when I ceased shuddering
and quaking as the hours of rehearsal
approached&mdash;my confidence came back. I
even surprised myself listening with pleasure
to my music, and distinctly remember having
thought at least at three occasions:</p>

<p>"Patrick, my dear, you are a splendid
fellow after all. You ought not to have been
so much impressed by the first seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
helpless trials of all these good people. How
all has improved! There are few living
composers, if any, able to conceive and to
write such a score. And to think that the
crowds will come and listen and applaud.
But will they understand? Is the crowd
sufficiently educated to appreciate my work?
Do I not stain the beautiful conception of my
fancy by submitting it to the crude judgment
of the crowd? Still, a crowd it will be; they
will come and listen and applaud. The
theatre contains room for fifteen hundred
people. There are about one hundred and
fifty seats so bad that nobody will take them,
but the remaining thirteen hundred and fifty
will be occupied at every performance. Now,
how many people will come and listen and
applaud? Be modest, Patrick, old boy. Say
twenty-five performances at an audience
each of thirteen hundred and fifty. Makes?...
makes?..."</p>

<p>I never knew, for I am bad at figures.</p>

<p>Altogether I was in high spirits, smiling
like Sergeant Young before a battle. By the
way, I do not know what has happened to
Sergeant Young. He has seemed sulky
since the other day, when he left me so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
abruptly. It pains me, for he is my particular
chum. And save what is needed to carry
on he does not utter a single word to me.</p>

<p>But I must not let myself go into a diversion;
I was speaking not of Sergeant Young
but of myself and of my high spirits. Yet
you must not believe that I was happy. I
have already stated that I was altogether
happy only during our performance in front
of Schubert. That sentiment of perfect
felicity never came back. And now, during
the rehearsals of <i>Lady Macbeth</i> I was bitten
by that "green-eyed monster, which doth
mock the meat it feeds on": jealousy.</p>

<p>As I am quoting <i>Othello</i> I may as well
say that the Cassio in my case was the pretty
Lieutenant Franz von Heidenbrunn. I suppose
that you have seen it coming a long time
ago, and I have only to record how the green-eyed
monster was hatched. No Jago was
necessary for me, nor was there any handkerchief
required.</p>

<p>The regiment in which the pretty officer
held his high rank had been shifted from
Salzburg to Br√ºnn. This was a coincidence,
and you will see a very unfortunate one for
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Every morning, when there was a
rehearsal, I went from Vienna to Br√ºnn by
the eight o'clock train which makes the
journey in a little over an hour. I used to
meet Mitzi at the Viennese Northern Station,
and we travelled together, which rendered
that hour as short as it was delightful.
Rehearsals in Austria as in Germany begin
at ten, and last from three to four hours.
Afterwards we had lunch and then we
returned by one of the numerous afternoon
trains to Vienna.</p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder why I did not prefer
to take up my quarters altogether in
Br√ºnn. Well, first there was that double
journey which I would have lost, as well as
the always pleasant company of my <i>fianc√©e</i>.
And in the second place there was Br√ºnn.</p>

<p>This town boasts of being the Austrian
Birmingham. I will not hurt the feelings of
my Birmingham readers, some of whom find
their large and busy city a fine and charming
place. If I don't share their taste entirely,
it matters little. But Br√ºnn! Br√ºnn with
its one inhabitant to Birmingham's ten!
Br√ºnn with its wide and empty roads in the
new town, and with its narrow and crooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
streets in the old one! Br√ºnn with its one
and only beautiful building: the Jewish
synagogue, and its one and only curiosity:
the lunatic asylum! Br√ºnn with its population
of manufacturers&mdash;most worthy people
no doubt, but with an interest only in buttons,
hooks and eyes, pins, steel pins, cotton
spinning and other kinds of engineering&mdash;Br√ºnn
was no place for me to enjoy myself
in the least.</p>

<p>Nor was it any better for Franz von
Heidenbrunn and his sister Augusta, who
were both all the more bored with the place
as the strict military regulations did not
allow the lieutenant to spend even an
occasional evening in Vienna. Their gratification
at meeting Mitzi several times a
week may easily be imagined. I will only
say that when Mitzi and I lunched at the
Grand Hotel, which is situated quite near
the theatre, covers were generally laid for
four. Of course, I was always allotted the
Countess Augusta, who proved a rather
insignificant girl, by whose side I remained
unfathomably calm, while Mitzi seemed to
enjoy the nuttish and, let me say it, silly
conversation of her partner, which is, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
believe, a privilege of most lieutenants in
Austria. I have, now, an idea that the talk
was also carried on under the table&mdash;what do
we keep feet for when dining?&mdash;but I was
too well brought up by Daniel Cooper &amp; Co.
to investigate the nether world.</p>

<p>Slowly the poison entered my blood.
"Trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation
strong." And soon I found myself
burning as by "the mines of sulphur."
(How good of Shakespeare to have provided
me with all the terms necessary to describe
my feelings.)</p>

<p>Had Mitzi been only my <i>fianc√©e</i>, I dare
say that I would have put a rapid end to the
matter. But she was also my <i>Lady Macbeth</i>
in formation, and this could not be forgotten
even for one moment. So I had to endure
my secret sufferings. Besides, I must say,
Mitzi was never as sweet to me as during
these days. Full of hope and confidence,
she always comforted and cheered me when
I was disheartened, which happened more
than once. Poor Doblana, who on his side
was busy rehearsing <i>Aladdin</i>, had no such
solace from her when he was dejected as, I
am sure, most composers are every other day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Our respective works were to be performed
nearly at the same time, <i>Aladdin</i> only about
ten days after <i>Lady Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>At last the morning of the great day
arrived. I must have given you a very wrong
impression of Daniel Cooper if you do not
know that he arrived the day before with
mater. They were very pleased with Mitzi,
although not a word was said about our
betrothal. And Daniel Cooper was greatly
amused by being called the "great Mr.
Cooper" by Doblana. It was on this
occasion only that I found out that the good
horn-player, who knew but few things save
what belonged to horns and ballets, mixing
up Insurance and Cooperation, had, when
I first told him about my father's trade,
thought that Daniel Cooper was the originator
of Cooperative Societies.</p>

<p>What Dad spent on that memorable
evening wants a special historian. I do not
speak of his innumerable tips, nor of a
basket of flowers which had to be transported
to Br√ºnn by the first Viennese florist
in a specially hired motor lorry. I speak
of such unexpected things as, for instance, a
magnificent set of diamonds he presented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
my mother in remembrance of my coming
triumph. Needless to say that mater, on
his special order, was attired like a queen,
and that Dad himself had a new dress suit;
an old one would never have been judged
worthy by him of listening to Patrick
Cooper's music.</p>

<p>The house was not very full. Besides
the one hundred and fifty seats which I had
judged to be too bad, there were about
another three hundred unoccupied, a fact
which totally upset my unfinished calculations.
However, it is well-known that in
German and Austrian provincial towns first
nights are not well attended, the general
public being rather mistrustful. But all my
friends of the Round Table and other
acquaintances were present, and they did
their <i>hand</i> work well. There was first&mdash;honour
to whom honour is due&mdash;the <i>Herr
Graf</i>, then old Hammer, on whose account
I had been obliged to invent a special scheme
so as to make him accept a railway ticket,
for he would not have been able to come
otherwise without imposing great privations
upon himself, Doctor Bernheim, and even
Giulay with his mother. Of course, Doblana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
had made himself free in order to ascertain
whether Miss Amizia Dobanelli was really
the she-cat that walked miaowing over the
boards. And he must have been deceived if
he expected such a thing, for hers was
an unparallelled triumph.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of theatrical managers, from
that of the Vienna Opera downwards, had
been invited, but only one, that of the Graz
municipal theatre had come.</p>

<p>The performance was good, as performances
in Germany and even more in
Austria generally are. I am not afraid to state
that a third-rate theatre, as, for instance,
that of Br√ºnn, would be ashamed of most of
our conventional society performances at the
Royal Theatre Covent Garden, in spite of all
the stars. Confound the stars, who can
never be brought to a complete, harmonious
agreement, who sing their parts each for his
or her own sake, and never think for one
moment of the work and its meaning.</p>

<p>From what I have told already, you may
have conjectured how very necessary such
harmonious ensemble playing was in my
<i>Lady Macbeth</i>. It was not a loud opera,
and I could expect that the critics would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
reproach me with being too noisy in my
orchestration. Indeed, it was found too soft
by those gentlemen, who never are satisfied.
They did not understand that this softness
was required for the general atmosphere of
my opera.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty had been with the
baritone Hetmann, who sang <i>Macbeth</i>. I
had great trouble in explaining him why he
was never to give full voice during the whole
evening.</p>

<p>Macbeth must not appear at the beginning
as a criminal. He is first a courageous
and truthful man. But he is a dreamer.
"<i>Look, how our partner's rapt</i>," says
Banquo. He is a dreamer who struggles
against the image of his phantasy. Nearly
all he says is aside. His reserve, his
taciturnity are awful. Whatever he speaks,
must be uttered as though against his own
will. Berlioz, once, to obtain a very tragic
effect, had a drum covered with a cloth.
Macbeth must be spoken with a voice
resembling the sound of such a drum. Nor
must he talk aloud in the banquet scene with
the ghost, where on the contrary he ought to
become entirely benumbed. He is not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
feelings, he speaks warmly of King
Duncan, and he loves his wife, knowing how
much he needs her.</p>

<p>That performance of <i>Lady Macbeth</i> was
for me and, I think, for some of the spectators,
a foreshadowing of new times in the
operatic art. It was a unique, incessant
horror for the audience as long as the fearful
score lasted&mdash;and it became the most attractive
scandal for all the people who search in
art nothing but the baseness they find in
every day life.</p>

<p>My opera is but a short one, taking two
hours to perform. Therefore no necessity
arose anywhere for pressing the movement.
Bischoff, who had staged it, had obtained
most wonderful effects. The singers seemed
to be going through the nightmare in which
they had a part. Scene after scene seemed
to shake with dread and terror. Bischoff
knew how to produce the biggest effects with
small means. Thus I will never forget that
there was a sort of small lamp burning
during the scene of the murder. The
trembling flame, now more reddish, now
more bluish, was flaring all the time. At
the precise moment when the murder was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
supposed to occur in the wings a sudden
squall nearly extinguished the light, and for
a couple of seconds all became dark; but in
the next instant the flame seemed bigger,
redder than ever and sooty. It was frightful.</p>

<p>The prologue, namely, the scene of the
witches and that where Macbeth wins the
title of Thane of Cawdor, went well. After
this, while the scenery was being built for
the first act, Macbeth's castle at Inverness,
the orchestra played my paraphrase of the
"Pibroch o' Donuil Dhu," the only vigorous
and energetic part of my score. Then the
real thing began, for only then Lady Macbeth
appeared.</p>

<p>Whatever I may say of her, will not
render justice to her incomparable performance.
Nobody could have resisted this
Lady Macbeth. Even when she had to
deliver a reproach, she did it trembling
with love. And as Bischoff and I had taught
her, she seemed to shudder at her hard, fearful
words.</p>

<p>She never seemed to sing, but to whisper,
to inspire with the means of the sweetest
seduction. She turned round her Macbeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
embraced him, clung to him so that sometimes
they seemed to be but one being with
two souls. How she sang all the hideousness
and atrocity of her part&mdash;how she
perfumed the blood of her words with
sweetest promises! She was what we had
asked her to be&mdash;more a spoiled child, who
foolishly craves for evil, than a heartless
criminal.</p>

<p>There was some applause after that act,
but the public seemed awed, so intense was
the impression. As I was hurrying to the
stage, I met dad.</p>

<p>"Oh, my boy!" said he and pressed both
my hands so hard that I thought he would
break them. His eyes were shining and I
could swear that there were tears in them.
That "Oh, my boy!" is the one beautiful
memory I have of that evening.</p>

<p>The next minute saw me at the door of
Mitzi's dressing room. I knocked.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked a voice, not
Mitzi's, but that of a woman I did not know.</p>

<p>I gave my name. There was some
whispering inside which I could indistinctly
perceive through the door, and then a woman
came out, opening the door so little that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
could not even have a peep at the inside.</p>

<p>"<i>Fr√§ulein</i> regrets," said the woman, as
if I had been a mere stranger, "she cannot
see you now."</p>

<p>One is above all the son of one's country.
I daresay no Englishman would have acted
otherwise than I did. I bowed to that
dressing woman as if she had been a noble
lady and went on to the stage.</p>

<p>There I found the manager of the theatre
chatting with his Graz colleague. They both
congratulated me, and the manager of the
Graz theatre complained about the coldness
of the public.</p>

<p>"You will find no such frosty people in
the south, in Graz," he told me, "for if you
are willing to let me have your opera at the
same terms as the ones you have here, I will
play it within two months. I should be
pleased if I could secure Miss Dobanelli for
the part of the Lady."</p>

<p>Yon may conceive how pleased I was and
how warmly I thanked him for such encouragement.
But the entre-acte being nearly
over we had to leave the stage.</p>

<p>My way back to the audience led me
past Mitzi's dressing room. Just as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
going by, the door opened and.... Franz von
Heidenbrunn came out. I thought that my
heart was going to stop. So Mitzi had
received him, while her door had remained
closed for me. I went on as in a dream.</p>

<p>Before the door of his box I found dad
and the mater.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked my old
Daniel Cooper &amp; Co. "Why are you so
pale?"</p>

<p>I was not going to spoil his pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am probably a little excited," I
answered. "And the manager of the Graz
theatre has just accepted the opera."</p>

<p>"That is splendid!" cried dad.</p>

<p>"Does he pay well?" asked the mater.</p>

<p>"That's the boy's affair," grumbled
Daniel Cooper, turning to her. "You mind
your own business."</p>

<p>A bell rang, and dad and my mother
went into their box, while I hurried back to
my seat.</p>

<p>During the whole act of the banquet I
could not find my senses. What was I to
do with Mitzi? I could not possibly ignore
the incident. I asked myself whether she
was not too much an artist to be a wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
What, if frivolity were unavoidable in the
dramatic art, the most corporal and difficult
of all, but the only one in which woman could
grow up to the highest genius?</p>

<p>These doubts spoiled the second act for
me. Yet I saw how lovingly she was stroking
Macbeth's forehead, like a nurse who
would cool the burning brow of a sick man.
I saw, too, how she smiled at the ghost, how
she mocked him, and I heard how she sang
the words: "<i>What, quite unmanned in
folly?</i>" and afterwards: "<i>Fie, for shame!</i>"
exactly as I had taught her, slowly, softly,
and more like a warning than a reproach.</p>

<p>There was even less applause after the
second act than the first. However, Doctor
Bernheim, whom you know as a sensible,
judicious man, came and heartily congratulated
me.</p>

<p>"In this particular case," he said, "the
success cannot be measured from the
applause. The public is much too moved to
applaud loudly. Instinctively they fear to
destroy the atmosphere."</p>

<p>I did not go on the stage after this act.
I was afraid lest I should meet Mitzi and say
one word too many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The last act began, and soon the famous
sleep-walking scene arrived. Never before
had the ruin of a poor, over-burdened heart
been acted thus.</p>

<p>She came.</p>

<p>At once I noticed that she was not
dressed as she had been the day before at the
dress rehearsal, when she had worn a long
night-gown. She came like a child, with
bare feet and bare legs&mdash;there was just then
the craze of dancers who appeared like that&mdash;tripping
full of anguish ... not in a night-gown,
but in a chemise ... looking tortured,
deceived, broken, a child vanquished in a
fight which was too much for her.</p>

<p>And with a voice more gentle, soft, and
lovely than anything which I ever heard, she
began. Sweet as the singing of a breeze
her voice vibrated through the soundless,
trembling audience.</p>

<p>"<i>Yet here's a spot.</i>"</p>

<p>How she wept after the words: "<i>Yet
who would have thought the old man to have
had so much blood in him?</i>"</p>

<p>And later: "<i>All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh,
oh!</i>" How she whined these three oh's! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
audience pitied her. And how helpless she
looked, with her poor, naked legs, in her
poor chemise....</p>

<p>Then ... then, when she had said the
words: "<i>To bed&mdash;to bed</i>," there came a
musical afterpiece in which I once more
repeated all the motives of the opera, including
the lullaby. Mitzi was slowly to turn
round and to remain there with her taper&mdash;showing
her back to the audience and
advancing only one step from time to time.</p>

<p>She had been rehearsing it with a long,
flowing night-gown; and now she was
standing there in that short chemise.
She had dared that! And to my horror I
saw that it was transparent, very transparent
even, and tight, and that it outlined
the contours of....</p>

<p>There! I am once more in difficulty. You,
chaste reader, who have accompanied me
through these pages, have surely noticed my
struggles at different times to find the right
expression for ... you know what I mean.
And this time I feel truly awkward because
I have reached an important point. I must
find a name for that lovely <i>it</i>, which had
seduced me from the very first moment I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
seen her, for <i>it</i> was pretty, so pretty, quite
bewitching.</p>

<p>Ah, Barrie! Thou who has invented that
charming name "Little Mary" for something
which was as difficult to baptize, help
me ... help me to find a name for it ... for that
darling ... for that double darling!</p>

<p>Double Darling?</p>

<p>Barrie! Did this idea come from thee?</p>

<p>I'll name it Double Darling, but being
shy, I'll write only D. D.</p>

<p>Well, I have explained that I was horror-stricken.
This, I must confess, is a lie. I
felt no horror at all, on the contrary. The
truth is that the attractive sight made me
forget my anger, my dejection. She did look
fascinating, and the wicked thing knew it.
She knew that she was bewitching and was
sure that she risked nothing by showing her
D. D.</p>

<p>Nor did she fail in her bold venture.
When a minute or so later she disappeared
in the background, and at the same time the
curtain was slowly closed, a storm of
applause broke forth as I never had
imagined.</p>

<p>Again and again Mitzi had to bow before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the public, although she disappointed it
somewhat by appearing hidden in a light
dressing-gown. But the wanton people had
had their sensation, they applauded and
shouted, and it reached a degree of real
paroxysm when dad's immense basket of
flowers was carried on the stage.</p>

<p>But the louder the noise was, the more
did I understand that nothing of it was
meant for me, for my work. It was not
<i>Lady Macbeth</i> over which the public
rejoiced, it was Mitzi's D. D.</p>

<p>I heard the people talk. There was not
one word for the misery of Lady Macbeth,
her sighs and her struggles and her wretchedness.
The crowd will never recognize the
nobility of suffering. No, they spoke of La
Dobanelli.... La Dobanelli in her little
chemise. The D. D. had been an event.</p>

<p>And the same thing occurred at the next
performances. Only that on the first night
the audience had been shaking with terror,
and that the following times it was shaking
with sensation ... or with deception, for many
people left the theatre with words of regret:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;it was not so wicked as all
that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The snobs of the town fell in love with
La Dobanelli by the dozen. One out of each
dozen was struck by the sweetness of her
voice, by her sublime acting, by her power
of remaining lovable even in crime&mdash;the
other eleven were in love with the D. D.</p>

<p>Anyhow, when we all met half an hour
after the end of the performance at the Grand
Hotel there was much joy in the air. Dad
was offering to my friends a superb supper
in honour of my first night&mdash;and they were
all present, you bet.</p>

<p>I asked mater how she had enjoyed my
opera.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's very pretty," she said. "I
like the lullaby very much."</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p>Father, on the other hand, was overflowing
with enthusiasm. These two were
always the same, never had they the same
opinion on anything. Yet, there was one
point on which they seemed to agree ... perhaps
because not one word was pronounced
on it. But their eyes seemed to implore me
silently:</p>

<p>"You will not marry that woman,
Pat!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt very uneasy. But I am a sport.
I bore it all in a decent way. Yet I thanked
God when the moment came for the parents
to leave. Business had allowed dad to take
only a very few days vacation, and they were
returning the same night via Dresden and
Cologne to England.</p>

<p>It was a happy necessity, for thus they
escaped the criticisms of the next morning.</p>

<p class="b1">I will divulge you the mildest:</p>

<p class="pbq">"The two Shakespearian birds of prey
were served us yesterday as a dish which
was neither fish nor flesh, concocted by our
great actor Mr. Bischoff, and accompanied
by a <i>sauce anglaise</i> prepared at a Worcestershire
(or is it a Yorkshire?) manufacture
by a certain Patrick Cooper, who
has&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;nothing in common
with Fennimore. But he has a wealthy
father, a London shopkeeper in the City,
and a mother who advertised yesterday her
descent from a jeweller's family.</p>

<p class="pbq">"There is not much to say about the
insignificant Cooperian music, except perhaps
that no other living composer would
have conceived and written such a score.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
As for the libretto, it is the mistake of an
intelligent man who has treated the subject
not from the immortal poet's dramatic
point of view, but shortsightedly from that
of the actor. Mr. Bischoff only forgot that
Shakespeare, too, was somebody, after all.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Mr. Hetmann was a pale, voiceless
Macbeth, and had it not been for the
d√©butante of the evening, Miss Amizia
Dobanelli, the performance would have
been a total fiasco. She played and sang
the Lady with charm as well as with
energy. But we think that a part as
<i>La Belle H√©l√®ne</i> would suit her particular
talent better than the ambitious Lady."</p>

<p class="p1">Is it not a blessing that dad is an
Englishman educated on such thoroughly
English lines that he knows no foreign
language? Blessed are the poor in education,
for theirs is the kingdom of ignorance.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Surprising as it may seem to you,
I had the courage, the next day,
to take the bull by the horns and
to ask Mitzi about Franz von
Heidenbrunn. She merely laughed.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "firstly I am your
fianc√©e, and as such must be very careful
with you. Secondly, Franz is my cousin,
and we have known each other for so many
years that we are like brother and sister.
Lastly, you knocked on my door at an awkward
moment, when I was changing my
dress. You did not want me to show myself
to you in my underwear, did you? While
Franz came three minutes later when I was
dressed again."</p>

<p>You go and argue with a woman if you
can. I could not. I just felt silly. And
I suppose I looked it. For she came near
me and stroked my cheek gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't make a face, dear," she said.
"I quite understand your feeling miserable
after having read the papers; but, never
mind, it will wear off...."</p>

<p>"I know, Mitzi," I answered meekly,
"I cannot have it both ways, and write an
opera that pleases us both, and the critics
too."</p>

<p>And there was no more discussion about
Franz von Heidenbrunn. Our talk shifted,
and I was informed, too late, alas! that the
Austrian critic, as well as the German, is
always prepared to write favourably for a
consideration, being hardly paid at all by
the newspapers themselves, and regards as
his legitimate victims such people who have
not made backsheesh arrangements in
advance.</p>

<p>On the third day <i>Lady Macbeth</i> was
repeated. This time the house was packed
full, even the hundred and fifty bad seats
were sold out. The question whether La
Dobanelli was wearing tights or not under
her chemise had been discussed in the whole
town, and had proved such an irresistible
attraction that at her first appearance she
was greeted with warm applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Franz von Heidenbrunn was again in
the audience. Whether he visited Mitzi in
the entre-acte I cannot say&mdash;I did not,
having no desire to be turned away again.</p>

<p>I also went to see the third performance,
which was exactly like the second one. The
same kind of audience, thirsting for a sensation,
and for the third time Franz von
Heidenbrunn among the spectators.</p>

<p>As we travelled back to Vienna, Mitzi
and I, we had a few words about her chemise
in the last scene.</p>

<p>"Was this the same chemise you had the
two first times?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"No," she replied laughing, "you do
expect a lady to put fresh linen on from
time to time, don't you?"</p>

<p>"That chemise was shorter than the
other," I remarked, more sternly than I had
intended to.</p>

<p>"Oh! An inch or two perhaps."</p>

<p>"An inch is much in those latitudes,"
I jested.</p>

<p>"Look here, Patrick," she answered
sullenly. "Let me alone with your remonstrances.
You ought to know by now that
I do my best for your opera, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
have been a complete failure without me."</p>

<p>She said it coldly, heartlessly. It made
me suffer. But, swallowing my torment, I
answered nothing, and we continued our
journey in silence. I felt that we were not
getting on at all nicely and wondered how I
was to educate her to be less of an artist,&mdash;and
more my wife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is in drama a certain system of
construction, as you ought to know.
Probably you don't, still there is. First
comes the exposition, then the opening of
the action, then the growth during which it
grows (of course) to the climax; then the
fall or, as it must sometimes be called, the
return which precedes the close. In life the
return which follows all climaces is always
nasty, and you wake up after every excitement
with a bit of a moral headache.
Hoping is an ungrateful business. Look,
for instance, at our friend Cotton, our good
Guncotton. He has finished his chemistry
treatise&mdash;think what it means to have written
all these formulas in the trenches&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
he has this very morning received the news
that his manuscript has arrived safely in
London. Now he walks about, his eyes full
of rosy dreams, of fears, and of hopes. And
I can so well understand his feelings, his
thoughts. Patrick Cooper went through all
these emotions. And afterwards, dear me!
Only my case was a worse one, for the devil
had amused himself in mixing the poison of
love into my adventure of artistic hopes and
ambitions.</p>

<p>And by the way, as I am talking of the
devil, it occurs to me that the little man
with the tuft of black beard on his chin, who
appeared to me four times, must have been ...
HE. He laughed, the evil fellow, when he
came for the fourth time and saw that his
matchmaking work was seemingly accomplished.</p>

<p>Yet lately I had not seen him again. He
must have been busy somewhere else.
Perhaps will you see a connexion between
his disappearance and the following events.</p>

<p>The fourth performance of <i>Lady
Macbeth</i> coincided with the <i>premi√®re</i> of
Doblana's <i>Aladdin</i> at the Viennese Opera.
I thought it was my duty to be present at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the day of honour of my master, a small
sacrifice indeed, as there was not much joy
for me in attending my own opera before an
injudicious public, which really came only
to see Amizia Dobanelli in her chemise.
Besides, as the opera was making money,
there was every prospect of more performances
taking place.</p>

<p>When I expressed my intention to
Doblana and to Mitzi the horn-player at
once objected. I could very well go and see
the dress rehearsal of <i>Aladdin</i> instead of the
first night.</p>

<p>I asked why I should be deprived of
attending the performance.</p>

<p>"I do not like the idea," said Doblana,
"of Mitzi being alone in Br√ºnn. I cannot
accompany her on that particular evening,
but I think that you, her fianc√©e, ought not
to neglect her."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Mitzi, "Am
I not old enough to remain alone for one
evening? If I am such a child, then surely
you will not consider Patrick grown up
either. He is but one year older than I."</p>

<p>"How will you manage?" asked her
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I will stay the night at the
hotel."</p>

<p>"I do not think that it befits a young
lady to stay a night alone at an hotel."</p>

<p>"All right, then I will go and stay with
Augusta."</p>

<p>Doblana acquiesced. But this time I
made an objection.</p>

<p>"Augusta," I said, "will be in
Vienna on that particular evening; she will
want to see <i>Aladdin</i>."</p>

<p>Mitzi glanced at me with an angry look.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," she protested, "Franz will
have no leave. He will be in Br√ºnn."</p>

<p>"That is just what I object to," I
declared. "The best thing would be for you
to return to Vienna. I will be at the
Northern Station to bring you home."</p>

<p>This was finally decided upon, and Mitzi
left us in the afternoon for Br√ºnn. At six
o'clock there came a wire from her addressed
to Doblana, just as he and I were about to
leave for the theatre.</p>

<p>It ran:</p>

<p>"<i>Safely arrived. House full. Best
luck to Papa. Mitzi.</i>"</p>

<p>An hour and a half later <i>Aladdin</i> began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>When you write your reminiscences, as I
am doing now, you will be supposed to talk
of other people. You will see how difficult
it is. I always want to talk about myself.
I remember things only inasmuch they
concern me. Other people's feelings are not
half as important to me as my own. Thus,
that evening, at the beginning they were so
intensely bitter, that I think I must record
them, although Doblana was the hero of the
day. I was, naturally enough, reminded of
my own first night ten days before. But
while <i>Lady Macbeth</i> had been played before
an unsatisfactorily filled house, the one to-day
was packed. All the imaginable beautiful
and jewelled ladies were present, while
at Br√ºnn the provincial simplicity of the
feminine public (the male part is about
everywhere the same) was so exaggerated,
that my poor mater's diamonds were, as you
have seen, thought worthy of a newspaper
notice. Whoever was of importance in
Vienna, political and military people,
financiers, diplomatists, and artists, was to
be found on that first night. One hardly
noticed that the great Court Box was empty,
and that no Royalty was present; for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the other noted members of Society had
come. I will confess that I felt jealous.
And this jealousy increased as the orchestra
started playing Doblana's music.</p>

<p>Oh, what an orchestra! We have a few
fine orchestras in London, but how much
superior are the Vienna Philharmonics.
Neither Munich, nor Dresden, can boast of
such artists. To hear one's music performed
by them must be heaven.</p>

<p>Such then were my feelings as <i>Aladdin</i>
began. Who would have thought that a
couple of hours later my sentiments would
be reversed and that instead of envying
Doblana, I would pity the poor fellow?</p>

<p>I had seen the ballet at different
rehearsals. <i>Joseph Dorff's</i> book was
clever, Doblana's music pretty, tuneful and
well scored, although in no way remarkable,
and the staging simply marvellous.
There is no Parisian nor Russian ballet
which can compete with those of the Vienna
Opera. Not only are the dancers and
mimics incomparable, but fortunes are spent
on the scenery and the costumes, which are
proofs of the most perfect theatrical taste.</p>

<p>The first act was placed before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
inside the famous cavern where Aladdin
finds the lamp. In the original tale this
cavern is uninhabited, but in the ballet there
were populations of pretty spirits and servants
of the lamp. These gave a pretext for
all sorts of charming dances. And there
was one dance which had a real success,
namely, that of the precious stones. It was
performed by small girls dressed as rubies,
emeralds, sapphires and so on, who formed
lovely groups representing the different
jewels. The whole had a kale√Ødoscopic
effect, changing from one second to the next,
and was uncommonly pleasant.</p>

<p>Yet this was nothing in comparison to
what was to come in the second and third
act. In the former there was the magnificent
arrival of Aladdin at the Sultan's
court. He came on a splendid white charger
and was accompanied by forty white and
forty black slaves, who afterwards showed
all the skill taught by the Viennese dancing
masters. In the last act there came the
<i>pi√®ce de r√©sistance</i>, namely, the building
before the eyes of the public, not in one
night, but in ten minutes, of Aladdin's
unique palace. Things of such kind are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
very easy to be done in fairy tales and not
much more difficult on a stage when the
manager disposes of unlimited wealth. All
the wonders of the Arabian Nights were to
be presented to the audience on that evening.</p>

<p>The first act had gone well, better even
than anybody had expected. There are
usually but short entre-acts in the Vienna
Opera. But first nights, especially of
Grand Ballets, are such social events that
they do not admit this rule in all its rigour.
Therefore nobody was surprised when the
entre-acte instead of the usual ten minutes
had lasted twenty. Groups had been chatting
and laughing and showing their toilettes
and jewels. But in the end everybody
had left the <i>foyer</i> and returned to the seats.
Yet nothing happened. The musicians were
at their places, but no conductor was present.
Ten more minutes passed. The
public gave signs of impatience, a thing
unheard of in this <i>sanctissimum</i>. But these
signs of impatience lasted one instant only.
Then the house became painfully silent.</p>

<p>I should have liked to go and see behind
the curtain what had happened. But this
was not a provincial theatre where such visits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
from the public to the stage could be permitted.
In this Imperial and Royal Court
theatre there were strict rules; and I could
only wait with the other people.</p>

<p>The wildest rumours began to spread.
The amount of improbabilities human brains
can invent in a few minutes is incredible.
And here two and a half thousand were busy
finding the extraordinary reason of this
long pause.</p>

<p>Yet as inventive as their brains were,
they proved no match for the reality. For
after three-quarters of an hour, which
seemed an interminably long time, a bell was
heard, and a gentleman in evening dress
appeared before the curtain. He was sickly
pale.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I
have much regret in announcing that the
further performance of the ballet <i>Aladdin</i>
has been forbidden by all-highest order. The
money for purchased seats will be refunded
to-morrow in exchange of the coupons of the
tickets."</p>

<p>The announcement had the effect of a
thunderstorm, putting an end to the suspense
of the last minutes. I could not say what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was greater, consternation, regret for the
composer, disorder among the discontented
spectators, or curiosity to know the secret
reason of this catastrophe.</p>

<p>For my part I left the theatre as quickly
as possible and went to the little side door in
the Opera Street, at the rear of the premises,
where Doblana was wont to leave. There
was already a terrific crowd. But although
I had (I have no more) the soft fingers and
delicate hands of a pianist, I possess also the
strong elbows of an English sportsman, and
I succeeded in reaching the door. Just at
that moment a man came out of the house.
He looked pale, haggard, with the expression
of a drunkard. It was Doblana.</p>

<p>He scarcely recognised me, but I pushed
my arm under his and led him away.</p>

<p>It was cold and foggy.</p>

<p>I shivered as I asked him what had
happened.</p>

<p>"It is the Archduke," he stammered,
"who has forbidden the performance."</p>

<p>There was something like a sob in his
voice.</p>

<p>"The Archduke? His own work?
Why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know myself."</p>

<p>After a few steps made in a painful
silence, he added:</p>

<p>"We had a little difference yesterday,
at the dress rehearsal, but nothing of
importance."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to cancel the dance of the
precious stones, saying that it was like a
<i>kindergarten</i> that had gone mad."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"Well, I objected to such a cut and
said: 'Nonsense, <i>Herr Graf</i>.' Thereupon
he sat down, pronouncing not another word
more."</p>

<p>"And what did he do to-day?"</p>

<p>"He did nothing. He did not even
come. During the first act a letter from the
First Master of Ceremonies was delivered,
saying that he forbade the performance to go
on."</p>

<p>"But how is it possible to treat the
public in this way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the public!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and went on
explaining:</p>

<p>"They are not supposed to be regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
spectators as in an ordinary theatre. They
are the guests of the Emperor, and they, as
it were, buy an invitation to assist at the
performance, which is in reality supposed to
be given not for the general public, but for
the private pleasure of His Majesty."</p>

<p>"And was there nothing to be done?"</p>

<p>"We have tried, that is why we had to
keep the audience waiting so long. The
conductor hurried to the First Master of
Ceremonies, and the Manager to His Majesty
himself, while I drove to the palace of the
Archduke. I was not received at all, nor
did the manager see the Emperor, and as for
the conductor, he was told by the First
Master of Ceremonies that he regretted, but
had to obey orders."</p>

<p>Instinctively, we had taken the direction
of the Karlsgasse. I had a very nasty
feeling, as if poor, innocent Doblana had
suddenly become a criminal, and I his accomplice.
I was dazed as if I had had a smack in
the face.</p>

<p>We were passing a large caf√© near the
Elisabeth Bridge, where Doblana and I
sometimes used to meet some friends.</p>

<p>"Let us go in," I said, "and show your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
self publicly. Make the best out of a bad
case. After all you are innocent of the
disaster that has befallen you. Go in, there
are surely a few journalists inside. Let
yourself be interviewed and protest against
the manner you have been treated."</p>

<p>You ought to have seen the terror in the
poor man's face. He opened his eyes, his
nostrils, his mouth and drew backwards his
lower jaw as if he had wanted to swallow it.
(As a matter of fact, he must have been
starving, for he had had no food the whole
day.)</p>

<p>"Protest!" he cried at last. "I?&mdash;Mr.
Cooper, you desire my death. As if my
situation was not sufficiently bad! This is
not a free country like yours, where you can
talk as you like. No! I have but one thing
to do, to go home and hide myself. I am
done for."</p>

<p>And so we went to the Karlsgasse. The
house seemed desolate to me. The servant,
Fanny's unworthy successor, believing that
we would sup outside and come home late,
had gone to bed. So I proceeded into the
dreary kitchen (a kitchen without a cook is
always dreary, and without fire it can drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
you to desperation) and made some tea on
the gas-stove, while Doblana who had lit a
cigar was walking up and down in the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>"It is terrible," said he at last, after
he had swallowed a little tea, "how Austria
is changing. What happens to me is but an
instance of the new spirit that reigns here.
Or should I not call it otherwise? This
spirit, which comes from Berlin, this
Pangermanic spirit is not a new spirit, but
a reactionary spirit, a dark, medi√¶val spirit,
a spirit that recognizes no right, but only
might. What this Archduke has done to me
to-day, in our time of enlightenment, is
nothing else than an act of medi√¶val
brutality.</p>

<p>"All evil comes us from Berlin. It
spoils our art, it spoils our music. What
they call the higher form is simply amorphous.
What they call deep ideas is empty
commonplace. The motives which are
behind it all are vicious, sensual, degenerate,
disgusting depravity. What we see in their
painting, figures now too long, now too
short, with swollen abdomens, with grinning
faces, we find in their music, in the grossness
of their motives, in the brutality of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
orchestrations. This music is a breath from
a stinking morass.</p>

<p>"And this is not all. Berlin is so
medi√¶val in its views that they want war,
universal war. War which will give the
death blow to Austrian music, for music does
not live in times of war. Fifty years ago
they said: Germany for the Germans! Now
they are crying: the world for the Prussians!
And as though Austria were a German
state, as though there were no Slavs
and no Italians in Austria, Berlin wants to
drag us into her war schemes. And they will
succeed. From our cruel paintings you can
see it, from our coarse, frightful music you
can hear it: they will succeed!"</p>

<p>Thus spoke Doblana, not a great
prophet, no, only a humble musician. Do
not believe, incredulous reader, that I make
him utter a prophesy after the event. Nay!
These words were actually spoken, a long
time before anybody, before even he who
spoke them, thought of the war, that war in
which I am fighting, that war which, as in
irony, Austria, gentle, joyous, dancing
Austria began.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch, and suddenly I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
remembered that I was to meet Mitzi at the
Northern Station. It was very late, perhaps
too late. Still by making haste I might
arrive in time. So I speedily went away.
But as it is always when you are in a hurry,
the taxi took a long, circuitous route, what
they call a short cut, and I arrived too late.
The train had arrived nearly ten minutes
ago, and I could find no trace of Mitzi at the
station.</p>

<p>Heaven knows what gave me the idea
that something was wrong. When I came
back to the Karlsgasse, I saw the light in the
windows of the <i>salon</i> as they had been when
I had left. I ascended the stairs and rang
the bell. Nearly at once I heard Doblana's
dragging step, who came to open the door.</p>

<p>"Alone?" he cried, in a state of utmost
anxiety.</p>

<p>Mitzi had not arrived.</p>

<p>The nervousness of the poor man was
terrible. Exhausted as he was I did not
dare to leave him, and I passed with him
the worst night of my life. I have only to
think of it to find any night in the trenches,
amidst the roaring of the shells, restful by
comparison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>At the earliest hour in the morning we
went to a telephone office where we asked for
communication with the Grand Hotel in
Br√ºnn. After a long half-hour we got
through, only to learn that <i>Fr√§ulein</i> had not
been seen on the previous day at the hotel.</p>

<p>We tried the theatre. The one thing
we heard was that she had been very successful
as always and had left immediately after
the performance.</p>

<p>We returned to the Karlsgasse. Mitzi
had not arrived. Only the postman had
called and brought several letters. None of
them being from her, Doblana threw them
carelessly into his pocket and asked me
whether I was coming with him to Br√ºnn.
Of course, I acquiesced. But I will confess
that I, so to say, made a condition of our
having some breakfast before. It may be
that youth is more hungry, but I could not
go on without food.</p>

<p>At last we sat in the train. We had
more than an hour before us.</p>

<p>Mechanically Doblana looked through
his letters, passing them silently to me. The
first was an invoice for flowers he had offered
the evening before to several dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The second was one of good Hammer,
written immediately after the interrupted
performance in very warm words, taking
part in the sorrow that had befallen his
friend.</p>

<p>The third was from the publisher. But
I could not read it to the end, for Doblana,
who was perusing the fourth one, suddenly
uttered a stifled cry.</p>

<p class="b1">The letter was from the Archduke.</p>

<p class="pbq">"My dear collaborator, my worthy
Mr. Doblana," (it ran about&mdash;I do not
recollect the exact words&mdash;), "I have taken
my revenge. You have treated my dear
wife like the basest of women, only because
the chief of my family had prohibited my
marrying her. Your behaviour was an
unforgettable insult to the best, the most
deserving and amiable woman, in whom
you have seen nothing but a despicable,
venal dancer. You have continued your
disdain, your hatred beyond the tomb.
What I have done is my retaliation.</p>

<p class="pbq">"It is I who have taken away from
your house and destroyed your <i>Griseldis</i>.
It is I who have prohibited the performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of your <i>Aladdin</i>, knowing that
I would hit you in your weakest spot, your
ambition. And I may as well tell you
that, while you may keep your position
as a horn-player at the Opera, its doors
are henceforth closed to the composer
Doblana.</p>

<p class="pbq">"You need not worry about the cost
of the production at the Opera. I have
made good the damage my vengeance has
occasioned.</p>

<p class="pbq">"As for you, I do not wish that it
should cause you any pecuniary loss. The
idea of having harmed my former collaborator
in this paltry way would be
unpleasant to me. I put the value of
<i>Griseldis</i> and <i>Aladdin</i> at 25.000 crowns
each and enclose therefore a cheque for
50.000 crowns to indemnify you.</p>

<p class="pn60 reduct">"<span class="smcap">Alphons Hector.</span>"</p>

<p class="p1">I cannot describe the wrath of my poor
friend. And I had to struggle with him to
prevent him from tearing the cheque to
pieces. And this may give you the measure
of his indignation. For you know how great
was his love of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>I should like to state that the Archduke
had moreover shown himself wrong in two
points. Ambition was not Doblana's weakest
spot, it was precisely money. Nor was
Alphons Hector's prediction right, for two
years later an opera of Doblana's composition
was successfully produced at the
Viennese Opera.</p>

<p>As for the Archduke, or the <i>Herr Graf</i>,
or <i>Joseph Dorff</i>, however you may call him,
he completely disappeared a few days after
the memorable <i>Aladdin</i> night. Some say
that he undertook a journey on his yacht,
and that it was lost with all hands. Other
people think that he has settled down to a
private life somewhere in South America.
In any case he was nevermore heard of.</p>

<p>But to resume my story. All researches
in Br√ºnn as afterwards in Vienna did not
succeed in finding Mitzi. The only clue we
obtained (it was from Augusta von Heidenbrunn
that we got it) was the fact that her
brother Franz had disappeared together with
my fianc√©e. He had, for her sake, become a
deserter.</p>

<p>A few weeks went by, which I passed
nearly without interruption on Doblana's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
side. He slowly recovered from the awful
shock this whole affair had caused him. Then
I proceeded to Graz to assist at the performance
of <i>Lady Macbeth</i> in this town.
Without Mitzi, without her overwhelming
talent, without her charm it was bound to be
a failure. And I came back to Vienna more
discouraged, more disheartened than ever.
Again I saw much of Doblana, and I can
assure you that we were a pretty pair of
dejected composers. On this subject I could
write pages, but out of pity for you I won't.</p>

<p>One day, as we sat there smoking, and
pondering silently over our shattered hopes,
the bell rang. We heard the maid opening
the door, and in the next minute Mitzi
entered. She was dressed exactly as I had
last seen her, but her features were drawn,
she was pale and seemed to have suffered.
In this moment I swore that I would avenge
her, if ever I could, of the scoundrel who had
brought her to this.</p>

<p>She had stopped at the door. We had
both, Doblana and I, risen in a violent surprise.
During an unterminable minute no
word was spoken. Then, at last, she
whispered piteously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>And as no answer came she said:</p>

<p>"Patrick, I have come back."</p>

<p>Again there was that gloomy, cruel
silence. And suddenly we saw her fall down
crying, sobbing, shaking. Then her father
approached her and lifted her up. He did it
with infinite gentleness, but he said no word.</p>

<p>My dear reader, you are perhaps a
sentimental person and you will, may be,
condemn your old friend Patrick for not
having made the movement which her father
made. But you see....</p>

<p>A few days before I had read William
J. Locke's novel <i>The Morals of Marcus
Ordeyne</i>, one of the most brilliant and
delightful this wonderful writer has
achieved. There was a certain analogy in
Mitzi's return and in that of Carlotta. Like
her she came back empty handed, having
also probably pawned everything. It was
heart-breaking, and like Marcus I felt faint.
Perhaps, if I had spoken one single word at
that moment everything would have happened
otherwise. However, my morals are
not the morals of Marcus Ordeyne&mdash;and that
one word, I spoke it not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly her father led her into her room.
I used the moment to slip out of the house.
I went to my lodgings, nearly mad, and
packed my things. The same evening saw
me on my way to England, never to go back.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XII.</h2>

<p class="pn p2">It is a very funny feeling I experience in
returning to these pages. I had left
them since the first of May, when I
wrote the last words of Chapter XI.,
and you will have noticed that several points
remained unsolved. In this state my MS.
had rested during six weeks, mostly because
I did not know how to fill the gaps. But
since yesterday things having changed, Fate
with a capital F has added another chapter
to my story.</p>

<p>You must know that we are getting ready
for a great attack. As far as we can ascertain
we are going in a few days to leave the
trenches where we have been living cosily for
so many months. Of course, you wonder;
feeling snug in the trenches is somewhat
unexpected. Yet it is true. And now the
unceasing bombardment tells us: "We shall
have to be going." Can you believe that it
fills us with a sort of regret?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday at noon Charlie calls Cotton,
Pringle, and me.</p>

<p>"My boys," he says, "the colonel has
just had a bit of a chat with me. He wants
four volunteers&mdash;three men and me&mdash;to go
to-night and reconnoitre a certain place. I
have thought of you three, but I had better
tell you: it's not without danger, far from
it."</p>

<p>"We're here," says I, "to do our duty."</p>

<p>"We'll have some fun, anyhow,"
declares Pringle.</p>

<p>And Guncotton adds:</p>

<p>"My manuscript is safely in London. I
don't care."</p>

<p>I record this conventicle lest you should
think that such resolutions are taken as in
opera, where the four men would advance to
each other and, uniting their four right
handy in one single grip, sing a quartette.</p>

<p>"All right," says Charlie, "so long!"</p>

<p>He is about to go, but I recall him.</p>

<p>"Can I have a minute with you,
Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Ten. What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"There is a chance of our not coming
back to-night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you funky?"</p>

<p>"Charlie, I haven't deserved this. You
know that I won't shirk."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it then?"</p>

<p>"It is ... it is simply that for some time
you are changed towards me, you've been
sulky, and I should not like to go off on the
long journey without having made friends
with you again."</p>

<p>He says nothing and stares into my face.
Then after a while he asks:</p>

<p>"Have you written any more of that
stuff?"</p>

<p>"What stuff?"</p>

<p>"That story of yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Yes. I have."</p>

<p>"Let's see."</p>

<p>I show him my story. He reads quickly,
very quickly, skipping half-pages; in short,
he reads as I should not like you, for instance,
to read it. In less than half-an-hour he has
run through all the pages. When he has
finished he takes a long breath as though he
felt relieved.</p>

<p>"Look here, P. C.," he says, "when you
began that story I thought it was all stuff
and nonsense. It amused me, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
I thought that you knew how to strike
a note of sincerity."</p>

<p>(I earnestly wish to point out that this
kind of criticism is not my own; I guarantee
that it is by Sergeant Young.)</p>

<p>He goes on:</p>

<p>"Very slowly it began to dawn upon me
that there might be more truth in your
narrative than I had first suspected. And
then you let me see that photo."</p>

<p>He stops and looks at me as if at a loss
how to go on.</p>

<p>"I had misunderstood what your story
was driving at," he continues, "I thought
that, as stories written in a light tone
generally do, it was to finish with a marriage ...
and, when I found out that it was a
story which had really happened, I believed
that you had married the lady of the photograph."</p>

<p>My dear reader, I promise you that I
will repeat it no more after this time, but I
must ask your leave to inform you once more
that I felt silly. And I continued so when
Charlie declared:</p>

<p>"I have known that woman."</p>

<p>"You have known her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" he cries, "do not suspect anything
wrong, do not jump to conclusions.
Do you want to know how it all happened?
By a lucky deal on the Paris <i>Bourse</i> I had
realized a sum of about 200.000 francs. I
never told you, that I used to live in Paris,
after the Boer war, years ago. Never mind.
Well, with my money I did a very foolish
thing: I bought a little hotel. It was called
'The Grand-duke's hotel,' and was a smart
place. Unfortunately, to keep a smart
custom, you must advertize, and for this I
had no money. Perhaps also to make a good
innkeeper a certain talent is necessary, in
which I was lacking. By and by my business
declined, not in elegance, but in turnover.
Still, there were always a few refined
and well-paying guests who encouraged me
to hope against hope. But one day&mdash;you
know the date as well as I, P. C.&mdash;there came
a couple who gave the concern its death
stroke.</p>

<p>"They travelled under the name <i>Count
and Countess Dorff</i>, but from the photograph
alone I could tell you, that the lady was your
Mitzi. However, there is another thing
which coincides with your account. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that they called themselves <i>Dorff</i> from the
Archduke's <i>nom de plume</i>, I do not mean
that, I mean another thing.</p>

<p>"On the ninth or tenth day after their
arrival they came home rather early and at
once retired to their apartment. Shortly
afterwards George, my head waiter, came
hurriedly into my private room, where I was
working, and informed me that they were
quarrelling&mdash;but so violently that I had
better come. I am sorry, P. C., to have to
show you an ugly side of an otherwise
honourable trade, but eaves-dropping is
sometimes necessary to an innkeeper. So I
went and listened. At first I could hardly
understand what they were saying, for
although I speak German as perfectly as six
other languages, I could not immediately
make out their peculiar Viennese accent.
Soon, however, I grew accustomed to it. The
quarrel was apparently about money matters.
Quarrels between couples in hotels
generally are. But after a while the object
of the dispute seemed to shift, they grew
louder and then fainter again. Through the
door of the next room, where I was listening,
I could hear one of the two people excitedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
opening a trunk and searching for something.
Then I heard the woman say distinctly
in an irritated voice:</p>

<p>'So your father took the papers?'</p>

<p>And the man answered:</p>

<p>'He did.'</p>

<p>'He stole the score of <i>Griseldis</i>? How
did he do it?'</p>

<p>'He had only to step into your apartment,
which a locksmith had opened for him.
He knew the room, he knew the very drawer
where the manuscript was kept, and he took
it.'</p>

<p>"There came several questions from the
woman which I don't remember, evidently
asking how the Archduke had prepared the
whole affair.</p>

<p>'He had obtained an engagement for
your father,' explained the man, 'to play a
concerto in Prague. He knew that this
would cause him to be absent for three days.
You had told Augusta that in such cases
your maid used to ask you for a holiday, and
my father had learned this detail by chance
from Augusta. There was but one more
difficulty: to remove you.'</p>

<p>"For a minute or so they both kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
silent; then suddenly the woman cried
fiercely:</p>

<p>'You sent me that wire!'</p>

<p>'I obeyed my father's orders,' answered
the man.</p>

<p>'And for a full year you let me be
suspected of being a thief ... protesting all
the while that you loved me?'</p>

<p>'I do love you ... and I regret....'</p>

<p>'Ah! you regret, you scoundrel! And to
show your regret you spoiled my life as your
father had spoiled my father's work?
Scoundrel, scoundrel, scoundrel!'</p>

<p>"I heard the man laugh, a cold, cruel
laugh.</p>

<p>'No!' she went on, 'you do not regret,
but I will teach you to repent!...'</p>

<p>"The next second I heard a report.
George and I broke in the door. She had
shot him through the left arm. I am afraid,
P. C., that you have never seen her look as
beautiful as I have.</p>

<p>"What more can I say? The next day
the affair was in the papers. I hoped it
would be an advertisement for the 'Grand-duke's
hotel.' It would perhaps have been
one for a bigger place or one that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
better known. As it was, it finished my
business. Three months later I was ruined.
You may believe me, P. C., that my wish to
be revenged on that scoundrel is as strong
as yours."</p>

<p>"And Mitzi?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Mitzi was arrested. But after three
days, as the gentleman had left the country,
she was restored to liberty. He had gone
away with all their luggage, and she possessed
nothing except a few jewels, which she
pawned. The proceeds did not suffice to pay
her journey home, not to speak of her bill,
for she had remained several weeks in Paris,
hoping to find an engagement, a hope in
which she failed. Finally I had to give her
a few francs in order to help her to return
to her country."</p>

<p class="p2">There, Mr. Reader, is what Charles
Young tells me. It leads you exactly to the
point&mdash;namely, Mitzi's coming home&mdash;where
I had left you.</p>

<p>Now, this is not all I have to report of
yesterday's memorable evening. I am sure
you wish to know all about the night expedition
of your four friends. You shall have
what you want.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>There is to the north-east of our trench
a little wood. The colonel wanted to know
what was in that wood, whether it was fortified
and how. Our aeroplanes had been
unable to give any information, nor had our
listening posts achieved any result. So there
was but one way: by scouting.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as night had come we
crawled out of our trench, armed to the
teeth, and after an hour's crawling we
reached the edge of the forest. To say that
it was an easy job would be an unnecessary
exaggeration, for there were German search-lights
unceasingly licking the ground. Yet
there was always time when we saw the
lights creeping nearer, to lie still for an
instant and to pretend that we were corpses.</p>

<p>"Can't you see," said Pringle once quite
aloud, as the ray was just resting on his
body, "that I'm dead? What's the use of
your lights having glasses?"</p>

<p>Charlie began to laugh, so that if the
beam by any chance had touched him, he
would certainly have been detected.</p>

<p>"Mind you," said I, "the blooming
thing is wavering."</p>

<p>"<i>La donna √® mobile</i>," sang Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
softly and added: "It's Hun-steady."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Sergeant," said Pringle, "it's
foolish to joke now."</p>

<p>"Hun-reasonable, you mean. Let's go
on."</p>

<p>"The ray is still too near," warned Guncotton.
"It is premature to move."</p>

<p>"Hun-timely?" corrected Charley.
"Perhaps; well, we have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Oh Sergeant, don't be cruel!"</p>

<p>"Do you really think me Hun-merciful?
It seems that my puns are Hun-successful...."</p>

<p>And so it went on for a time, while we
lay motionless under the rays of the search-light.
Yet the Sergeant did not cease thinking
of anything else than words beginning
with an optional Hun.</p>

<p>But when we were inside the wood our
real business began. It consisted in reaching
a certain spot where in all probability a
small detachment of Germans was posted,
for it was a naturally sheltered part. Should
no Germans be there, then we were to come
back and if possible our troops were to
occupy it during the same night.</p>

<p>We had been walking silently when the
Sergeant suddenly stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are here," he whispered.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"We have orders in case of no Germans
are there," said Guncotton. "But if there
are some?"</p>

<p>"I think it's clear," declared the Sergeant.
"Either kill them, or take them
prisoners."</p>

<p>From a spot at a distance of about a
hundred yards there came the buzzing murmur
of many voices, conversing probably in
a peaceful manner.</p>

<p>"They are too many to kill," said Guncotton.</p>

<p>"But not to take prisoners."</p>

<p>And Charlie at once invented a plan of
attack.</p>

<p>Accordingly we began talking gently at
first, then louder and louder, until we
shouted all four for all we were worth.
Finally Charlie in his strongest voice gave
some orders, which Pringle repeated different
times, sometimes at a higher pitch, sometimes
at a lower, and always a little fainter.
He is a ventriloquist, you know. While he
was doing this, Charlie and I rushed forwards
on to the Germans who were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
greatest disorder, having been taken entirely
by surprise.</p>

<p>"Surrender," cried we both.</p>

<p>There were two German officers who
advanced. We explained to them that as
we were eight hundred they had better give
in. All this time Pringle was going on with
his orders, given in ever so many voices,
which seemed to come from different directions.
And suddenly Guncotton produced
his will-o-the-wisp trick, which completed
the illusion. He was causing lights to
appear to the right and the left, so that our
Germans (they were forty) seemed entirely
surrounded.</p>

<p>The success was complete, and an hour
later we were bringing in our bag of officers
and men. Only ... by some sort of a miracle
the men's figures had grown. They were
ninety now.</p>

<p>"This time I have got my commission,"
said Charlie to me as we entered our
trenches.</p>

<p>But somehow, in our excitement, instead
of returning to our own quarters, we had
taken a wrong direction, and we arrived at
a part distant from ours by more than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
miles. Still, you may imagine, whether we
were well received.</p>

<p>The colonel on duty congratulated us
and asked for our names. To my utter
surprise Charlie gave his as ... Friedrich
Wilhelm Young.</p>

<p>As we marched away through the communication
trenches, cheery and mirthful, I
asked Charlie why he had given this name.</p>

<p>"I did not," he said.</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"You did," asserted Pringle and
Cotton.</p>

<p>"You are spinning me a yarn."</p>

<p>"We are not," we declared unanimously,
"you gave your name as Friedrich
Wilhelm Young."</p>

<p>He remained silent, absolutely cast
down. Never have I seen a man so overcome
as poor Charlie was that minute. At
last he said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's done it. I must have been
too excited. Farewell, my commission!
We'll drink that bottle of champagne to-morrow."</p>

<p>And we shall. At last!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more I open these sheets, which I
have had to neglect for four full mouths.
And you will be surprised, my dear friends,
who have escorted me to Austria and France,
to hear that I am no longer writing this in
the trenches, but in Belsize Park.</p>

<p>I suppose I must tell you all. Following
<i>Major</i> Young's advice, I will begin by the
beginning. In fact, I have already begun by
informing you in one single word that
Charlie&mdash;he will always remain Charlie for
me&mdash;has at last met with success. Bad luck
evidently ceased to exist from the moment
when we emptied that bottle of champagne.
On being questioned about his real name he
made a clear breast of the whole story of his
identity; and thus, what had not brought
Sergeant Charles Young a commission, has
finally brought Captain Friedrich Wilhelm
Young a promotion.</p>

<p>That occurred on the last day of June.
On the first of July, 1916, the great attack
began. I am not going to describe that big
affair. It has provided so much copy to
professional writers that a poor amateur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
like me has no more chance. But how we
rushed out of the trenches! Poor Cotton&mdash;on
that very morning, an hour before the
action began, he had received news from the
Royal Society of Chemists that they were to
publish his treatise at their expense, and he
had said to me with an elated expression:</p>

<p>"Now I can die calmly: I know that I
will not die altogether."</p>

<p>Poor Cotton was perhaps the first to be
killed.</p>

<p>As for me I find it absolutely impossible
to tell you what I did. You know that
feeling: When you wake up in the morning
you remember sometimes that you have been
dreaming, but cannot recall the slightest
detail. It even happens that while asleep
you intend to remember a certain detail of
your dream; yet, in the morning it is clean
forgotten.</p>

<p>I cannot say how long I remained in that
fight, two, four, six hours, or more perhaps.
The only thing I recollect is a feeling of
infinite comfort when I woke up, and how it
gave way instantly to an unbearable agony
in my right foot. I was lying in a bed, and
the bed was in a large tent with many others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Dazed as I was, I realized that I must have
been wounded, but I felt too tired to think,
or even to keep my eyes open.</p>

<p>A soft hand stroked my brow lightly and
a gentle voice said a few words. I opened
my eyes again. A nurse was standing there,
with two surgeons. They uncovered me and
undid the bandage which was hiding my
foot. Then one of the men said to me:</p>

<p>"You are a courageous man. You will
not be afraid of a little operation?"</p>

<p>"It can't hurt more than it does now.'</p>

<p>"It won't hurt at all."</p>

<p>"Then go ahead, sir, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. We think, my friend
and I, that you have one foot too many."</p>

<p>I reflected one moment. This was
rather unpleasant. But what could I do but
put a cheerful face on an ugly matter? So
I said:</p>

<p>"Right you are, but don't make a mistake."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" asked the
surgeon.</p>

<p>"You might cut off the sound foot, by
mistake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said he smiling. "That's
the spirit we want. We will do it in a
couple of hours. Try to sleep in the meantime."</p>

<p>The next time you have an opportunity,
Mr. Reader, you make an effort to sleep with
such a prospect before you. A cripple; I
would be a cripple. What would life be in
future? It is not such a very easy thing to
stand on two feet, but on one! You must
be a virtuoso for that ... or an acrobat. Anyhow
I would be out of the ghastly business.
For I may tell it now, it was hellish,
altogether.</p>

<p>But at last, it was over for me. I had
done my bit.&mdash;Done my bit&mdash;Done my bit.&mdash;And
I repeated twenty, fifty, a hundred
times that "Done my bit" like an engine
that says the same thing unceasingly. Yes,
I would go home, back to Blighty. Done my
bit.&mdash;Done my bit.&mdash;What would dad say?
Poor dad! He would feel it more than I.
He would tremble when he saw my name in
the casualty list. And he would cry and be
proud that I had done my bit.&mdash;Done my
bit.&mdash;Done my bit.&mdash;And then he would buy
an artificial foot for me, the best he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
find. In fact he did, and I am not so much
to be pitied as you may think. Really not. And
the mater ... she would scold me, no doubt.
In fact, she did it too:</p>

<p>"My poor Patrick," was her first word,
"how can one be such an awkward bungler?
What did you do with your foot?"</p>

<p>"I apologize, mother," I answered, "I
have mislaid it. I must have left it in
France. Do you want me to go back and
fetch it?"</p>

<p>Thus, you see, I could not sleep during
these two hours, as I had been told to.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I was lying there, I heard
a voice, a very faint voice to my right, calling
me:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cooper!"</p>

<p>Slowly I turned my head. I could not
turn anything else. And there, by my side,
lay pallid, cadaverous, Franz von Heidenbrunn.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I?&mdash;I am dying."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"But how did you come here? Why are
you not on the Austrian front?"</p>

<p>Very slowly the answer came:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"I became a deserter, when I eloped
with Mitzi. I never returned to Austria.
I served with the Germans."</p>

<p>He was very weak, I could hardly hear
his words. And I, too, felt so feeble that I
was scarcely able to speak.</p>

<p>After a while he began again:</p>

<p>"You know that old Hammer died?"</p>

<p>"Poor Hammer," I said. "And
Doblana?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>There was another silence. How exhausted
he looked! And I had sworn that I
would avenge myself on him.</p>

<p>"Giulay is married," he whispered.</p>

<p>Evidently he wanted to speak about my
Viennese acquaintances. But what could it
matter to me whether Giulay was married?
Was it to Fanny? I wondered. The answer
to my mute question came soon.</p>

<p>"To Mitzi."</p>

<p>Giulay and Mitzi! So they had both
been satisfied with remnants ... he with what
Franz, and she with what Fanny had left.
Such was the end of my Austrian Love.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. Longer,
deeper than before. His breath was difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
already rattling in his throat. But
after a while he seemed once more to find
a little strength.</p>

<p>"Can't you forgive me?" he asked at
last.</p>

<p>"I do forgive you, with all my heart."</p>

<p>He became calm, and it seemed to me as
if a dim smile was passing over his features.</p>

<p>He died the same night.</p>

<p>Three or four weeks went by. I was
doing splendidly, as people say whose feet
have not been amputated. I had been
removed to another tent where there were
only men who had behaved well, like me for
instance, and who could be allowed to read,
to smoke, to chat. Don't you believe that it
was a sorry company. There was not one
complete specimen of the species man. But
we bore our lot cheerfully.</p>

<p>To say the truth I had not, for years,
felt so pleased, so satisfied. The nightmare
was over. When I recollected the years
between my flight from Vienna until the
outbreak of the war, and then the terrible
months in Gallipoli and in France, I
regarded my present situation as perfect
bliss. Perhaps also had I freed myself, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
writing my story, from the ever torturing
memory of her, whom I have called my
Austrian Love. For the first time Life was
smiling again.... Life and Music. I may as
well tell you that since I have returned home
I have begun writing a symphonic poem. I
hope you will come one day and applaud it.
I found its themes while I was in that cheerful
hospital. I found something else, too.</p>

<p>You know, of course, that in the
hospitals kind people are always providing
poor devils like me with all sorts of entertainments.
If there was a proof necessary
to show that music is not only an expensive
noise, (what of a bombardment, then?) you
have only to make inquiries about the number
of concerts given to the wounded.
Singers, pianists, violinists, unknown and
famous, come to brighten our time of convalescence.</p>

<p>Such a party, one day, visited our
hospital. The names were not celebrated
ones, but we did not mind. The renowned
artists were not always those we liked best.</p>

<p>There was first a man who played the
violin. I remember it was Godard's
<i>Berceuse de Jocelyn</i>. Then a baritone, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
sang popular ballads. He had a beautiful
voice and I should have liked to see his face.
But I was still in bed and not allowed to
move; and from where I was I could only
hear, but not see the performers.</p>

<p>And then the piano attacked sounds
familiar to me. And a feminine voice
began:</p>

<p>"My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
is not here...."</p>

<p>Good God! What was that?</p>

<p>Mitzi?</p>

<p>Had her voice changed so much? Had
she used her Italianized name to sneak into
this country? She alone knew that song....
And yet....</p>

<p>I tried to sit up, in spite of the doctor's
orders. But a nurse, who, as I discovered
later on, had special instructions, noticed
me and came nearer.</p>

<p>"You are not to move, you know," she
said smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh let me!" I begged.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>

<p>The song was over and the men
applauded.</p>

<p>All of them, except one, Patrick Cooper.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">And the voice began again:</p>

<p class="ppq10">
"Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,<br />
Who never to himself hath said,</p>
<p class="ppn15">This is my own, my native land!..."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">That could not be Mitzi!... she had
always been unable to sing that song.</p>

<p class="ppq10">"Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,<br />
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd,</p>

<p class="ppq10">From wandering on a foreign strand!..."</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The voice seemed to come nearer.&mdash;Yes!
the singer had left the platform....</p>

<p class="ppq10">"If such there breathe, go, mark him well...."</p>

<p class="p1">Now she appeared.</p>

<p>"Bean!" I cried.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And we are to be married to-morrow.</p>
